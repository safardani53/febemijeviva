I mean, what it means to Maci. I'm lost."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MACI BOOKOUT">READ MORE ON MACI BOOKOUT</h2><p>A third commenter responded: "We can’t tell you what it means to Macy because that is her personal business and decided not to post the details. The quote is saying that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s ok to make them."</p><p>"Learning from your mistakes is painful but an important part of personal growth," added a fourth.</p><p>A fifth fan stated: "Everyone makes mistakes and that’s ok no one is perfect!! Who are we to judge one another?"</p><p>While a final commenter addressed Maci directly, writing: "Don’t worry we all have! And we live and learn, nobody is perfect."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>DOING BETTER</h2><p>Maci got personal while talking with a friend after co-star <a href=#>Cheyenne Floyd's racist run-in</a> during the cast trip to Florida.</p><p>During a recent episode of&nbsp;Teen Mom: The Next Chapter,&nbsp;Maci&nbsp;went out to lunch to catch up with her pal Raj after getting home from the cast vacation.</p><p>The pair discussed the trip, and the Tennessee native shared with her friend that co-star&nbsp;<a href=#>Cheyenne struggled and faced racism</a>&nbsp;at the rodeo.</p><p>She recalled: "People were telling&nbsp;<a href=#>Cheyenne</a>, 30,&nbsp;to go home. Like, she talked to us afterward. She felt unsafe.&nbsp;She was so distraught but really holding it together.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think for me I just took away like big time just, it’s not her responsibility all the time to just sit and deal with it and carry it the whole time."</p><p>Maci went on: "It’s just retraining my brain to not just be a privileged white person that doesn’t have to deal with it."</p><p>She added: "I do notice things that I need to be better. I mean we have conversations with our kids but the younger ones</p><p>"I’m just trying to think of age-appropriate ways to keep the conversation open."</p><p>Later in the episode, Maci and her husband,&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor McKinney</a>, 33, sat their kids down to discuss race.</p><p>Fans took to Twitter to react to the activity, praising the couple.</p><p>"I love how Maci & Taylor has these conversations with their children, it's beautiful, and more white counterparts need to do the same..." one user wrote.</p><p>Another tweeted: "I appreciate [Macy's] attempt to teach her children about race, racism, and humanity. Many people aren’t doing that."</p><p>The incident in question took place episodes earlier, with the moment and more captured on camera.</p><h2><strong>SINGLED OUT</strong></h2><p>Early in the trip, it was clear&nbsp;Cheyenne&nbsp;was uncomfortable, as she called her father, Kyle, to detail the "awkward" trip to that point.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel like every room I walk in I’m the only black girl and everyone turns and looks at me," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after the conversation, she and the rest of the&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV</a>&nbsp;show's cast went to a rodeo where things quickly got even sourer.</p><p>Cameras captured rodeo members cracking whips and racing around the arena while attendees milled out in the stands.</p><p>Cast member&nbsp;<a href=#>Amber Portwood</a>&nbsp;– unaware of what was going on – appeared to be having a good time and was supported by&nbsp;<a href=#>Catelynn Lowell</a>.</p><p>Cheyenne, however, was uncomfortable enough to get up and walked out with&nbsp;Maci&nbsp;following not far behind.&nbsp;</p><p>Sitting outside the rodeo, she confessed: "I don't think I want to go back in there."</p><p>Back at their glamping sight, the cast gathered around the fire pit.</p><h2><strong>CHEY'S GONE</strong></h2><p>An irate Cheyenne, however, hung behind with a producer.</p><p>Visibly upset and emotional, she said: "Why is it that I’m the only f**king person who sees all the f**king confederate flags? Why am I sitting there? You saw it. I saw it. So what the f**k?"</p><p>Her producer suggested: "It’s still worth a conversation."</p><p>The mom-of-two hit back: "For what?" to which her producer said: "Because you’re working with all these white people and they probably don’t know it and now they need to know it."</p><p>Seated at the fire, Cheyenne said: "If they didn’t see it in the first place then that’s the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>"But understand. You’re black, I’m black. Since we’ve gotten here I’ve literally felt like the uncomfortable black girl in the group as always. I’m always singled out for being black. Always. It's f**king frustrating but I can’t say that because that’s not politically correct."</p><p>She appeared to get emotional as she spoke, fighting back tears."</p><p>Costar&nbsp;<a href=#>Leah Messer</a>&nbsp;nervously interjected: "I thought it was because of gunshots."</p><p>Cheyenne and her new-husband Zach Davis were involved in a&nbsp;<a href=#>scary shooting</a>&nbsp;that left her with some PTSD.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>California</a>&nbsp;native went on: "I literally put my mom, my dad, Zach, and my sister in a group chat and said ‘help me. I’m so uncomfortable. this s**t is scary.’"</p><p>She then asked: "When you guys walked into the rodeo did anybody notice the confederate flags on the shirts? That’s the difference is that I can point ‘em out and you guys don’t see it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/cover-girls-teen-mom-fans-704609645-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/teen-mom-maci-bookout-admits-775729854.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/teen-mom-catelynn-lowell-fans-715875533-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaGyAcn%2BUaKuenZ5iurC5jJ%2BYp6tdrLyzvsiem2alkZi2bq7OqKKoraRiwKmt0Z6qZpuirr21tcJmqK6npJp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./todays-lingfield-racing-results-full-results-from-lingfield-live-on-itv.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Today's Lingfield racing results: Full results from Lingfield live on ITV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oscars-2019-spike-lee-wears-love-hate-rings-purple-for-prince.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spike Lee Wears 'Love' and 'Hate' Rings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
