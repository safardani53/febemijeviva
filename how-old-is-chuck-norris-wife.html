Kelley was diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis in 2013. So, it is essential to take MRI scans to diagnose the real problems.</p><p>And it is an essential practice that the person has to use some dye before MRI scanning because that dye will provide some clarity while scanning so that the problems can be seen visibly.</p><p>And Gena had that medicine, and the MRI scan was finished. But after the scanning process,</p><p>Gena felt a little burning sensation in her whole body, and her pain was exhilarating day by day.</p><p>So again, she went to a doctor and underwent multiple tests and scans, and they finally determined that the dye used for MRI scanning was poisoned with gadolinium substances.</p><p>And that substance caused all her pain. And here is the statement shared by Gena about her medical condition:</p><p>When I arrived, they would ask me what was wrong, and I would tell them that I didn’t know, that I didn’t feel well, and that I felt like I was burning as if I had acid inside my body.</p><p>Here’s the saddest part: Gena couldn’t recover fully and became bedridden after that.</p><p>And Chuck Norris also decided to retire from his acting career to take care of his wife, Gena.</p><p>I gave up my film career to focus on Gena.
