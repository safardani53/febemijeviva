She was so hard on me. I mean, it was just brutal. And she was worth every bit of it because she’s just incredible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jessie-James-Decker-Says-4th-Pregnancy-Is-On-the-Easier-Side.jpg><p>Jessie remembered her second pregnancy with son Eric being “pretty easy,” but noted that baby No. 3 — son Forrest — was “pretty hard” on her as well.</p><p>“This baby, I would have to say … is probably right there with my second pregnancy where it’s on the easier side. I never threw up, which was nice, which is good,” Jessie revealed. “Every pregnancy is so different, but it’s been easier. I haven’t had any aversions really. <a href=#>Just been wanting to eat everything as usual</a>.”</p><p>The Kittenish founder <a href=#>announced in August that she is expecting her and Eric’s fourth baby</a>. At the time, Jessie shared a video via Instagram that showed off her growing belly with <a href=#><strong>Mariah Carey</strong></a>’s “Always Be My Baby” playing in the background.</p><p>As her due date grows closer — Jessie told Us she’s “having the baby early next year” — she is embracing the familiarity of carrying a child.</p><p>“I think I feel at ease as far as once the baby’s here, I know what to do. I felt that way when Forrest was born,” Jessie told Us. “I had a moment in the hospital, and they put him in my arms where I just looked at him and I had this moment where I said to him, I was like, ‘We got this, we got this. We know what we’re doing.’”</p><p>She confessed that since it has been about six years since her last pregnancy, she might be “rusty in some places.” When it comes to parenting, however, Jessie isn’t worried.</p><p>“I do feel like those maternal instincts are always there, and I am not afraid of anything once the baby’s here,” she explained. “But I definitely keep having these moments being like, ‘Oh, is that supposed to happen? Oh, I forgot this. Oh, your boobs do let down.’ I don’t have any milk to come out yet, but I can feel that. I feel everything and it’s all coming back to me.”</p><p>Add in <a href=#>raising her three children and Jessie is juggling a lot</a> — but she is happy to do it. “We were truly good with three [kids],” she revealed. “But I just feel like God always has other plans. And as soon as we found out, I mean after the shock wore off a little bit, I just cannot imagine life without this baby already.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jessie gushed: “And I don’t even have this baby in my arms yet, but I’ve always been very maternal and I’ve always just — I love being a mom. So for me, I just can’t imagine life without this baby. I’m so excited. I’m all in. I’m ready. I’m ready.”</p><p>With reporting by Andrea Simpson</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnaOotqZ5yZqknqtdmbKkt8SrZKyZqah6dcDHZqernZejrq%2Bv2GagrGWfo3q1tMRmnJqrmZq%2Fbr%2FInZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lottie-tomlinson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lottie Tomlinson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jermon-bushrod.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jermon Bushrod</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
