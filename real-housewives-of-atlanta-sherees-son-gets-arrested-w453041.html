On the Sunday, December 4, episode of <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>, it seemed that (almost) every woman was struggling and stressed. The one exception, perhaps, was <a href=#><b>Cynthia Bailey</b></a>, who celebrated her pending divorce by putting an offer on a million-dollar lake house. The rest of them, however, had challenges to overcome.</p><p><b>Sheree’s Son Gets Arrested</b></p><p><a href=#><b>Sheree Whitfield</b></a> had a serious talk with her son, Kairo, who had been arrested the night before. “I was so upset and hurt when Kairo called me from jail last night about a DUI. I had no words to say. I needed to calm down before I talked to him about this,” she recounted. Kairo admitted he had smoked pot earlier in the day, but said he was actually pulled over for an expired tag. As far as Sheree was concerned, that hardly mattered. “You are not on the same playing field as a lot of other people,” she explained. “Do you understand that?” Kairo said he did, but she wasn’t convinced, so she enlisted her ex-husband, Bob, to help.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bob’s talk with his son began with Bob admitting he had a license to smoke marijuana himself. Ultimately, however, Bob got the message clear and got Kairo to promise both of them that he would make better decisions.</p><p><b>Phaedra and Porsha Take a Stand</b></p><p>Continuing her mission to “Save Our Sons,” <a href=#><b>Phaedra Parks</b></a> recruited <a href=#><b>Porsha Williams</b></a> to attend the Democratic National Convention with her. While first preparing for their pending trip, Phaedra discussed her divorce from Apollo, which was still not finalized because he refused to cooperate. Phaedra said she was “trying to be fair,” but also wanted it all “to be done.” Porsha offered to help Phaedra find a new man. They then headed to the convention where they attended a panel discussion about the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>Kenya Plans Matt’s Birthday …</b></p><p>Still riding high from Matt’s family reunion, <a href=#><b>Kenya Moore </b></a>planned a birthday celebration for her younger man. She took a cake-decorating class with Cynthia. (Kenya’s plan was to give Matt a Gucci-themed cake with a real Gucci belt on the top to replace the one he had lost.) Kenya then told Cynthia that for Matt’s birthday, she was planning a couples’ ATV outing — which meant Cynthia wasn’t invited. “You become a single lady and gain your independence, but all of a sudden your invitations are getting lost in the mail,” Cynthia whined to the camera.</p><p><b>But Matt Doesn’t Show Up</b></p><p>It turned out Cynthia probably could have gone to the birthday party, however, because Matt didn’t show up for it. “We got into this silly, petty — I don’t even know if you could call it a fight,” Kenya recounted to Cynthia over the phone. Apparently, Kenya had posted a photo of herself with Jay Z from a music video she shot with him for Throwback Thursday — and Matt got really angry about it. “He just starts banging on walls, knocking stuff over, and just being silly like a little kid,” Kenya explained.</p><p>To the camera, she wondered if this was a bad sign for the future of their relationship. (It was.) “What are we going to be arguing about when things get a little rocky?” she asked, noting that things had been going really well between them before she posted the pic. Cynthia said hopefully Matt would get over it in time for the birthday celebration, and then informed Kenya that she had made an offer on a (gorgeous) house by a lake that she’d seen.</p><p>Matt didn’t get over it in time to celebrate his birthday. Instead, he went to California to hang with his sister. “It’s completely embarrassing,” Kenya admitted. “But I thought it would be worse just to cancel this whole event. I know how to put on a brave face.” She then went ATV-ing with a few other couples, including <a href=#><b>Kandi Burruss</b></a> and Todd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Todd Gets Marital Advice From Peter</b></p><p>Things might not be going that well if you’re getting marital advice from someone in the midst of a divorce — but maybe Peter had valuable lessons to impart. Things were definitely tense between Kandi and Todd since they had fallen a whopping three months behind on the construction of their restaurant, so Peter came by to check out the space.</p><p>He ended up giving Apollo pointers on how to keep his marriage strong. Peter began by taking a few passive-aggressive shots at Cynthia. “I guess our workload was too much for her. She’s not built the way I am,” he began. “I love Cynthia…but after a while, people drift apart. She’s on her own track. I’m on my track.” Todd said he sometimes wondered if he was spending too much time with Kandi.</p><p>Peter speculated that part of why his marriage fell apart was that Cynthia didn’t believe in him the way a wife should. “Any time they’re not in sync with their support, there’s going to be turbulence,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><b>Kandi’s Mom Sets Up a Sex Date for Kandi</b></p><p>Peter wasn’t the only one who noticed Kandi and Todd might need a boost. Kandi’s mom, a.k.a.&nbsp;<b>Mama Joyce</b>, saw that Kandi and Todd were really stressed out and not spending quality time together — so she set up a date for them. It was basically a date to have sex. “They work so hard,” Mama Joyce explained. “At least Kandi does.” She said she thought her daughter and son-in-law needed a little romance. “Kandi is probably as rusty as a drainpipe,” she mused.</p><p>She then set up a romantic situation in the master bathroom with sex toys and such. “It’s kind of funny when your mom puts out your sex toys for you,” Kandi admitted to the camera. Still, she got on board and even changed into some sexy lingerie. Todd was thrilled with Kandi’s outfit, but noted that he had “to do better” than have Mama Joyce set up his sex night. He was right.</p><p><b>Phaedra Gets a Bomb Threat</b></p><p>Just as the episode was about to end, Phaedra got a call from her assistant at the office because there had been a bomb threat. “I’m not really sure what to do,” Phaedra said to the camera, clearly freaked out. She told her mom to get the children and get out of the house. Then they prayed together over the phone.</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: Do you think Kenya and Matt will work through their fight, or is this the end?</p><p><i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta </i>airs on Bravo Sundays at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmemZxitbDB0p6uoq6VqHqwsoyaq6WZnqmubr%2FHnqmenaNiwLC6jKCcratdlr%2BzsdKtnJ1lp2mCdHyTamY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alp-navruz-19900115-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alp Navruz (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cesar-acuna.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Csar Acua net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
