He was known to ad-lib his sketches — even surprising his scene partners — and won a Golden Globe Award for the series in 1976, along with Emmys in 1973, 1977 and 1978.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At a 2013 event promoting his memoir, What’s So Funny?

In the L.A. Times interview, he remembered misplacing his rifle before a 4 a.m. drill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I looked in the garbage and there was this long neon tube,” he remembered. “So I took that. As the lieutenant came around the corner. I said, ‘Halt.’ I am pointing this bulb at him and he said ‘What is that?’ I said, ‘It’s a light bulb and if you come any closer, I’ll turn it on.’ He had very little sense of humor. I spent an extra two weeks [in the service] painting rocks in Seattle.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After his military service, he worked at a local station in Cleveland.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had no professional training.

Times. “She said why don’t you just be a regular on the show? I said I will tell you what. I will do 32 shows and leave one week open at the end, so I can guest on somebody’s show. I always guested on her show, but I did have the right to go somewhere else. My job on every show was to break everybody up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His own sitcom, The Tim Conway Show, had lasted one season in 1970.

She alleged that Charlene was “planning to move him out of the excellent skilled nursing facility he is currently at” and place him into a lesser quality home. She claimed her father could not “properly provide for his personal needs for physical health, food, and clothing” and is “almost entirely unresponsive.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Days later, Kelly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sought a temporary restraining order</a> to stop the move.
