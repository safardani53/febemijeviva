Do I seem like a person that did that?” he asked rhetorically. “No, hell no. That’s so stupid.”</p><p>The reality series, which premiered earlier this month, is based on the South Korean <a href=#>Squid Game </a>web series created for Netflix. The show revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all suffering financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children’s games.</p><p>Like its fictional counterpart, Squid Game: The Challenge also began with 456 contestants from around the world. 259 were eliminated in the Red Light, Green Light game where they attempted to cross an arena without being caught by a giant robot doll.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Squid-Game-The-Challenge-Players-Were-So-Desperate-for-Chapstick-They-Used-Lubricated-Condoms-1.jpg><p>When the remaining players arrived in the dorm, they were given their own small, personal bag of toiletries, plus communal toiletries were also available in the bathrooms. However, lip balm was not provided, and soon the participants were desperate to moisten their lips.</p><p>Some players then turned to unwrapping the condoms provided on set to lubricate their dry lips.</p><p>Plutnicki, 25, who participated in the challenge with his mother, <strong>LeAnn Wilcox Plutnicki</strong>, attempted to solve his chapped lips with other items.</p><p>“There was lotion, there was conditioner, and those were the first two tries,” he said. “And after I tried those and they weren’t working, I was like, ‘Well, that’s all of our options, because obviously we’re not going to use the condoms.’ And within a day, maybe a day and a half, all the condoms were gone. It was absurd. And it still didn’t work!”</p><p>Eventually, players were given their own tins of lip balm, which Plutnicki used before being eliminated in the tenth game, titled Glass Bridge, while his mother, 65, was sent home after being eliminated in the ninth game, Marbles. Before leaving, contestants faked their own deaths.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now only three people remain in Squid Game: The Challenge. <strong>Mai,</strong> player 287, is a 55-year-old immigration judge from Virginia.
