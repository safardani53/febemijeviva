They're becoming a popular kitchen tool, and unlike most, DrinkMate's version allows you to make any&nbsp;beverage (without pulp) fizzy, from wine to iced tea. We decided to give it a go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lifestyle_blk_410-02-14z_1800x.jpg><h2><strong>Drinkmate Kit with 60L CO2 Cylinder</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Drinkmate Kit with 60L CO2 Cylinder, £99.99 at Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2><strong>Pros</strong></h2><ul><li>Makes any drink fizzy (even alcohol)</li><li>Simple step-by-step instructions</li><li>Useful valve to stop any foaming explosions</li><li>Easily portable</li><li>Takes up small amount of space</li><li>Option to come with CO2 cylinder</li></ul><h2><strong>Cons</strong></h2><ul><li>Not as fancy-looking as other carbonators</li></ul><h2>Is Drinkmate worth it?</h2><p>We had never tried a carbonator before using Drinkmate, so first of all, we were relieved to find how straightforward it was to attach the CO2 canister, taking a matter of minutes to set up the whole gadget.</p><p>Upon first impression, it's quite a basic design that's light to carry around so you can transport it anywhere if you needed to.</p><p>Although this is practical if you're going camping or taking it to a friend's house, we were a little underwhelmed at how simple it looked on display in the kitchen.</p><p>In terms of the actual function of Drinkmate, it can't be faulted, especially thanks to its amazing slow-release valve that stops any uncontrollable foaming accidents.</p><p>We felt our inner mad scientist come out as soon as we sipped our first creation of fizzy orange squash - which was tasty but not sweet enough - desperate to try as many others as our fridge contents allowed.</p><p>Sparkling water met our expectations, but we were pleasantly surprised at the bubbly versions of smooth orange juice, white wine and rosé. The Drinkmate valve really makes any liquid possible because you can monitor how much gas you release at the end, controlling the foam, bidding farewell to past carbonator-mishaps that you might have experienced from using liquids other than water.</p><p>If you're looking for a carbonator to make any type of drink fizzy then this is definitely worth it, and it also comes with a CO2 gas canister so you can use it as soon as it arrives, unlike other designs on the market.</p><h2>How do you use Drinkmate?</h2><p>As directed in the booklet which arrives with your Drinkmate, first of all you need to attach your CO2 carbonator by removing the back cover, twisting off the cap of the canister and proceeding to install it in the back, tightening it by hand.</p><p>You then pull the bottle assembly forward 45 degrees and remove the bottle to fill it up (to the max line) with whatever beverage you wish to fizz-ify – Drinkmate state not to use drinks with pulp in as it can cause damage.</p><p>Once you've reattached the bottle, you press the top button for around 25 seconds and watch science happen! Then - the most important bit - you take the bottle out and slowly release the gas using the trusty valve.</p><p>When the CO2 has fully escaped, you're good to drink – don't make our mistake and take the lid off without releasing gas from the valve because the big bang and mess it'll make isn't worth the hassle.</p><h2>Is Drinkmate better than Sodastream?</h2><p>Back in 2009, 17-year-old Sodastream relaunched, spurring carbonator nostalgia for many people who used it back in the 70s and 80s. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that it trumps all carbonators.</p><p>Drinkmate has won a lot of people over because it works so well with a variety of beverages, whereas Sodastream only works with water and various syrups – all hail that trusty valve we keep talking about.</p><p>Both Drinkmate and Sodastream are around the same price, so it really depends on what you want to use your carbonator for, as they're both cordless and also compatible with the same CO2 canisters.</p><p>We can't give you a direct answer as to whether Drinkmate is actually better than Sodastream because we haven't yet tried out the latter.</p><h2>What canisters are compatible with Drinkmate?</h2><p>Most CO2 cylinders available online are compatible with Drinkmate machines, more specifically <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">their own</a>,&nbsp;Aarke, Sodastream and other brands that offer 60L/425g/14.oz size cylinders.</p><p>Drinkmate recommend keeping extra cylinders on deck so that you're never disappointed when you run out of one and have to wait for another to come in the post.</p><p>The brand also take back your empty canisters at their own expense in the UK, allowing them to clean, refill and reuse them! We're here for the recycling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a_agaiaZabag.jpg><h2>Where can I buy Drinkmate?</h2><p>At Amazon and Drinkmate's official site, you can buy the Drinkmate machine without CO2 capsules for just £79.99, whereas with cylinders (recommended), it's £99.99. However, Selfridges also stock Drinkmate's CO2 cylinders.</p><p>They are also available in red, white or matte black – take your pick depending on your kitchen's colour scheme.</p><p>Here's where we found them:</p><ul><li><strong>Drinkmate Kit with 60L CO2 Cylinder, £99.99 from Drinkmate - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Drinkmate Sparkling Beverage Maker with 1L Bottle and CO2 Cylinder, £99 from Amazon -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Co2 Carbonated Refill Cylinder 60l, £25 from Selfridges - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more sun selects home</h2></p><p>Whilst you're here, why not check out our review of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GHD Platinum + Hair Straighteners</a>.</p><p>We've also found the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">best pressure cookers</a> to shop now.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Sun Selects home</a> is your go-to for shopping guides, news and deals on homeware.</p><p><i>If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpraWqDdX6SaJuroZ6guqLAxGaamqqSpLuiwM6rZKudpp6yuHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./exclusive-wedding-photos-of-ariana-grande-dalton-gomez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Exclusive Wedding Photos Of Ariana Grande &amp;amp; Dalton Gomez</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./courtney-reagan-proposed-to-on-air.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Courtney Reagan: Proposed to On Air!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
