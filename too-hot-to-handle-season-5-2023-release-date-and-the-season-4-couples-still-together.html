Handle season 5 lands just in time for a summer of love, so here’s everything we know about the 2023 release date and where the previous couples are now.</strong></p><p>Things are heating up on <a href=#>Netflix</a> again this summer and it’s not because of the weather. <a href=#>Too Hot To Handle</a> season 5 is arriving for another series of flirting, drama, and of course, no sexual activity – read on to find out more about the 2023 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/THTH_4_Unit_00258_RT-1024x683.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-too-hot-to-handle-season-5-release-date-confirmed>Too Hot To Handle season 5 release date confirmed</h2><p>Season 4 had <a href=#>reality TV</a> lovers invested in the private lives of 14 strangers as they dumped the singletons on a romantic resort under one condition: no sexual contact with one another.</p><p>Fans were looking forward to season 5 before the finale even aired, so we’re happy to say that the next series will release on July 14, 2023.</p><p>Netflix confirmed the season 5 renewal in mid-January, before announcing the premiere date on June 16. “As if it wasn’t hot enough already. Too Hot To Handle Season 5 arrives 14 July!” they tweeted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=too-hot-to-handles-initial-prize-money-has-never-been-won>Too Hot To Handle’s initial prize money has never been won</h2><p>Contestants had the potential to win $100,000 (season 1 and 2), and $200,000 (season 3 and 4), but the figure has never remained at the six-digit sum.</p><p>The grand prize is reduced every time a cast member engages in sexual activity, from kissing to self-gratification. This means contestants every year have been guilty of at least some form of physical intimacy.</p><p>Season 1’s final prize money saw the total drop to $75,000; it was split between the 10 remaining contestants, totaling $7500 per person.</p><p>The second season saw Marvin Anthony take home the entire reduced $55,000 cash prize after the two other finalists voted for him. It was a massive win for Marvin but clearly, the season 2 gang didn’t hold back their friskiness.</p><p>Seasons 3 and 4 saw couples Beaux and Harry, and <a href=#>Jawahir and Nick, sharing the prize</a> money of $90,000 and $89,000, respectively.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=lana-the-host-was-nicknamed-after-a-nsfw-act>Lana the host was nicknamed after a NSFW act</h2><p>Sun, sand, sea, and no sex isn’t the only twist of Too Hot Too Handle. The hit Netflix show isn’t hosted by a human. Instead, the singletons take instructions from a cone-shaped device reminiscent of Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa.</p><p>Portrayed as Too Hot To Handle’s superior overlord, Lana the AI surveils the cast’s every move and sounds its PDA alarm when any contact rule is broken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/THTH_5_Unit_00041_f-1024x683.jpg><p>We hate to ruin magic but we must clarify that Lana isn’t actually a genius device keeping the contestants in check. It is only a speaker and the voice was created by a team of experts so there is no sole real human behind it.</p><p>Lana’s script is reportedly created by producers who watch the cast and program instructions into the device.</p><p>If you’re wondering why the cone is called Lana, just spell out the name in reverse – definitely NSFW!</p><p>As for the narrator, the voice is courtesy of real human Desiree Burch, an American comedian and actress who has found fame in British comedy panel shows.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-too-hot-to-handle-filmed>Where is Too Hot To Handle filmed?</h2><p>Forget the <a href=#>Love Island villa</a>, Too Hot To Handle cast are truly treated to paradise on earth.</p><p><a href=#>Too Hot To Handle season 1 was filmed</a> in Punta Mita, Mexico at the Casa Tau estate, which will reportedly set you back $15,000 per night.</p><p>The following three seasons took it a step further by jetting the cast off to Turks and Caicos, the archipelago known for its turquoise waters and white sand beaches.</p><p>Season 4 filming took place at the&nbsp;Emerald Pavilion, described as a premiere beachfront estate. The 6000 sqft interior is designed with floor-to-ceiling glass doors and five luxurious bedrooms, while the 4200 sqft beachfront pavilion is enough to entertain 20 people.</p><p>The property costs $7250 per night – a bargain compared to Casa Tau.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/THTH_4_Unit_00104_f-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=which-too-hot-to-handle-couples-are-still-together>Which Too Hot To Handle couples are still together?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=emily-miller-and-cam-holmes>Emily Miller and Cam Holmes</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emily Miller (@emilyfayemiller)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>The season 2 couple didn’t win the prize, but they came out on top with their romance. They moved in together shortly after leaving the Turks and Caicos villa.</p><p>Fans were devastated when Emily and Cam unexpectedly parted ways in April 2022 but as of June 2023, the couple have reunited and are happier than ever.</p><p>Both stars admitted that they “weren’t in a good place”, but have since moved forward. Despite being a reality TV couple, they never addressed the reason at the time of the split.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=brittan-byrd-and-james-pendergrass>Brittan Byrd and James Pendergrass</h3><p>Model Brittan Byrd and <a href=#>athlete James Pendergrass</a> were one of the fastest pairings of season 4 but failed to make it to the final. Their zero-rule breaks should have earned them a spot because isn’t that the aim of the game?</p><p>They took time off briefly after filming as they didn’t know where they stood with each other at the time. But they later confirmed they are in the “dating phase”.</p><p>Brittan and James haven’t posted any loved-up photos in recent months but since they’re following each on <a href=#>Instagram</a> and haven’t announced a split, we can only assume they are still going strong.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=kayla-richart-and-seb-melrose>Kayla Richart and Seb Melrose</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sebastian Melrose (@sebmelrose)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>Season 4 runner-ups Kayla and Seb are still in their honeymoon phase as of June 2023.
