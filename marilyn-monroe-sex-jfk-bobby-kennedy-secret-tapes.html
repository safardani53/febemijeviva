claims to have installed listening devices in the actress' home as well as the beach house&nbsp;at the home of John and Robert's brother-in-law, Peter Lawford.</p><p>Peter and their sister Patricia Kennedy Lawford were renowned for holding wild parties where <a href=#>Marilyn</a> would meet the brothers in private at the couple's beach house in Palm Springs.</p><p>Speaking about the secret recordings, Danoff said: "I'm beginning to recognise the voices, the Bostonian accent and Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>"I heard the President call Marilyn, 'Marilyn', or Marilyn calling the President the 'Prez'.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MARILYN MONROE ">READ MORE ON MARILYN MONROE</h2><p>Fred Otash, the investigator who worked with Danoff adds: "There

cuddly talk and taking off her clothes, the sex act in the bed."&nbsp;</p><p>He also describes how they heard 'arrangements for meetings' with not just Jack but brother Bobby, who visited the star's home many times.</p><p>He adds: "There were more tapes made out of Robert Kennedy and Monroe as opposed to Jack Kennedy and Monroe."</p><p>John Danoff was employed by private investigator and ex-cop Fred Otash, known as one of the best in the business.</p><p>Otash was in turn hired by a rival of the Kennedy brothers, union leader Jimmy Hoffa, a famously corrupt man who was well connected to the Mafia.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Hoffa was furious after being targeted by Attorney General Robert Kennedy over his illegal activities and was desperate to dig up dirt on the brothers.</p><p>Otash explains how Marilyn's home as well as the Lawford's Palm Springs property and beach house was bugged.</p><p>Talking about the tapes, he says: "They were placed under the carpets, in the chandeliers and in the ceiling fixtures."</p><p>The Lawfords held some of Hollywood's most famous parties attracting Hollywood's rich and famous.</p><p>Peter was a member of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack and married the Kennedy's sister Patricia in 1954.</p><p>Dean Martin and his wife Jeanne were regular

during her final days and the extent of the<a href=#> Kennedys' involvement</a>.</p><p>Monroe allegedly had romantic links with&nbsp;<a href=#>JFK&nbsp;</a>and his younger brother Robert but, both men refused to commit as they were married with children.</p><p>She also told columnist and writer Sidney Skolsky that she was in a relationship with Bobby's brother John and that the two were intimate on several occasions.</p><p>In the days leading up to her death, sources claimed Monroe told confidants that she was pregnant with one of the Kennedy's children, but she was forced to "lose the baby."</p><p>The bombshell doc also revealed documents that suggested Monroe was privy to nuclear government secrets that made her a threat to the Kennedy family and the country's national security.</p><h2 id=close-relationship>'CLOSE RELATIONSHIP'</h2><p>Robert Kennedy claimed to have been nowhere near Monroe's home on the day she died but witnesses have placed him at her property before she passed.</p><p>JFK was assassinated in November 1963 and years later, Robert Kennedy was also assassinated in June 1968.</p><p>In the week leading up to her death, Monroe spent a lot of time making phone calls to old friends and acquittances.</p><p>She called her gynecologist Dr. Leon Krohn to ask if he was angry with her about a previous miscarriage.</p><p>She also phoned her friend, real-estate agent Arthur James, to discuss her possible impregnation by one of the Kennedys.</p><p>The day before her death, she called her long-time friend Anne Karger to say she was going to marry Bobby Kennedy.</p><p>She also called friends in Washington to try and reach Bobby, including Robert Slatzer and Kennedy's brother-in-law Peter Lawford.</p><p>On the morning of her death, she called actress Jeanne Carmen, who told Vanity Fair, that Monroe sounded distressed.</p><p>"She said some woman had been calling all night, harassing her and calling her names,” Carmen said.</p><p>“The voice sounded familiar, but she couldn’t put a name to it. The anonymous caller had said words to the effect 'Leave Bobby alone, you tramp. Leave Bobby alone.'"</p><p>Carmen also said that Monroe asked for sleeping pills and wine, but Carmen declined her request.</p><p>Later the day of her death, a friend, Agnes Flanagan showed up at Monroe's home.</p><p>At 4.30pm, Monroe phoned her psychiatrist who came to her home until 7.00pm.</p><p>Her psychiatrist told LA suicide watch professionals that he had "had calls that morning and by the time I saw her she was in a rage.</p><p>She had recently had sexual relationships with "extremely important men in government...at the highest level", the doctor claimed.</p><p>Monroe allegedly said that she was supposed to see one of those men that night, and was angry that the plans fell through.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728595311.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000728359757.jpg><p>At 9.30pm, Monroe called her hairdresser Sydney Guilaroff.</p><p>Guilaroff told Vanity Fair that "Marilyn telephoned me in despair.
