However, the 21-year-old has a far bigger following base than simply YouTube subscribers.&nbsp;Chamberlain has her own coffee business, a line of goods, and partnerships with Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Levi’s, and other brands.</p><h2>Emma Chamberlain’s climb to popularity on YouTube</h2><p>High school can be a life-changing experience for many individuals, and Emma Chamberlain was no exception. Her YouTube audience has been able to see her metamorphosis, both personally and professionally. Initially, Chamberlain released frequent YouTube videos like try-on hauls and lookbooks. But when she began to video more vlogs of herself doing normal things like grabbing iced almond milk lattes and thrifting, Chamberlain’s true personality began to emerge.</p><p>She is best described as a “lifestyle vlogger” since her films record everyday happenings in her life.&nbsp;Chamberlain’s videos were also more entertaining, owing to her unique and quirky editing abilities, which helped her distinguish out from other YouTube lifestyle vloggers. This editing technique also becomes her distinctive “brand.” Other YouTubers quickly began imitating her editing style, which included jump cuts, zoom-ins, and distorted effects.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Emma-Chamberlain-1.jpg alt="Emma Chamberlain" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rather than showcasing her high-end collections, Chamberlain preferred to share her dollar-store finds with her admirers. Her success was due to her reliability. Emma Chamberlain relocated to Los Angeles at the age of 17, which likely influenced her YouTube career. At this moment, she began hanging out with “The Sister Squad,” which included James Charles, Ethan, and Grayson Dolan.&nbsp;Many supporters began to express that they missed the “old Emma” at this time and that she had changed dramatically after moving to Los Angeles. Nonetheless, Chamberlain has said that this was a difficult phase in her life due to the pressures of living in Los Angeles and maintaining a big YouTube channel.</p><p>Chamberlain has also been open about her life on YouTube, particularly when it comes to more tough subjects like anxiety and despair. Because of her propensity to be honest and sincere, her subscribers have formed a personal connection with her, making her a fan favorite.&nbsp;Emma Chamberlain has made a reputation for herself outside of the YouTube community, from appearing on Cosmopolitan covers to launching her own coffee company, Chamberlain Coffee.&nbsp;The invitation from Louis Vuitton to visit Paris Fashion Week in 2019 was another watershed point in Chamberlain’s YouTube career. She went from being an ordinary adolescent to walking the Met Gala red carpet and becoming a Louis Vuitton brand ambassador.</p><p>Emma Chamberlain, on the other hand, took a 6-month break from her YouTube channel from December 2021 to June 2022 to concentrate on her mental health. In March 2022, she said on her podcast Anything Goes:</p><p>“Being a weekly YouTuber 365 days a year is impossible, yet it’s the norm,”</p><p>Adding to that:</p><p>“It is the level that YouTubers hold themselves to, but it is hard to maintain psychologically.” I never want to put something out there that I’m not proud of.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Emma-Chamberlain-2.jpg alt="Emma Chamberlain" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, on June 22, 2022, the YouTuber relaunched her channel with a video titled “what’s nice about new york.” While Chamberlain’s previous movies were more hectic, her most recent ones are calmer and have a near-perfect cinematic quality. Slow zoom-ins of individuals going about their regular lives are interspersed with relaxing music in the videos.</p><h2>Emma Chamberlain displays her new Los Angeles home</h2><p>Emma Chamberlain was just announced as the newest celebrity to have her house featured in Architectural Digest’s September 2022 issue. The house expertly represents its owner’s calm, easygoing demeanor and intriguing sensibility. Chamberlain claims that:</p><p>“Because I work from home, I wanted to make something absolutely personal and comfy,” she said.</p><p>“I used influences from several decades and design periods to create something that seems not just unified but also fresh. It wasn’t about subscribing to one style or obeying the rules. I tried to approach everything with levity and an open mind.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>currently manifesting emma chamberlain’s house <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ikXVMnLRnu</a></p><p>— ModernGurlz (@ModernGurlzz) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2022</a></p><p>Despite the home’s luxury, Emma Chamberlain’s engaging personality shines through in her modest touches. Fans can’t get enough of her house and have taken to social media to express their delight. According to her followers, Emma Chamberlain retains the title of “YouTube Queen” due to her “down-to-earth” manner, as well as commanding large views on her videos and collaborating with designer companies.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Emma Chamberlain</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>YouTuber</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuscymmGabmJa6o7HRpZiipl2aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYsawwYynnJ6cXam8brfNqK5mmZKkwrV5x56paA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stoner-quotes-for-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>19 Fun Hidden Stoner Quotes for Your Instagram</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whitney-port-dishes-on-the-hills-the-city.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whitney Port Dishes on The Hills, The City</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
