In addition to the Clippers and&nbsp;Nets,&nbsp;Blake also played for&nbsp;Detroit Pistons between&nbsp;January 2018 and&nbsp;March 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>What also sets him apart from other players&nbsp;on the field&nbsp;is, presumably, his thick skin which&nbsp;does not let him&nbsp;meltdown under&nbsp;pressure and helps him perform to his best capacity. And it turns out the credit for his tough build goes to&nbsp;Blake's family, which comprises his parents and older brother,&nbsp;Taylor Griffin. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Blake Griffin Was Trained by His Father</h2><p>Blake's father, Tommy Griffin,&nbsp;who is of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Afro-Haitian descent</a>,&nbsp;was a basketball center and track standout at Northwestern Oklahoma State University. He is also&nbsp;one of the most successful high school basketball coaches in Oklahoma, with&nbsp;nine state championship wins&nbsp;as a head coach. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Tommy, therefore,&nbsp;coached Blake, putting all his experiences during his training in high school at Oklahoma Christian School in Oklahoma City.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The result?&nbsp;Blake matured into one of the most coveted recruits&nbsp;at OCS, where he averaged 26.8 points and 15.1 rebounds as a senior and was named a McDonald's All-American. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Every day in practice, the first 45 minutes would be fundamentals," the 32-year-old <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told Dallas News</a>, crediting his father&nbsp;for his success. "It really helped me a lot." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The&nbsp;basketball pro also credits his mother, Gail Griffin, who is white, for helping him stay fit since she has always been big on health and nutrition.</p><p>Mentioning how his mother home-schooled him until he was in the seventh grade,&nbsp;Blake said, "She's also instilled a lot of values in me. She basically has done everything for us." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Brother’s Roughening Up</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Like his parents, Blake's brother,&nbsp;Taylor also had a big role in incorporating an excellent&nbsp;work ethic into his system.</p><p>In the stated interview with Dallas News, the 6 feet 9 inches tall star recalled his&nbsp;driveway <a href=# rel=follow>basketball</a> games with his older brother, who played for Pallacanestro Trapani of the Italian Serie A2. He said those matches often had an ugly ending.</p><p>"We had some serious battles, and they always finished in a fight," Blake said. "Every single time, it didn't matter. Normally, not a fist fight, but yelling and throwing the ball at each other." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Because of that, he hated losing to his brother and&nbsp;always played with a drive to succeed at any cost. But that drive eventually transformed into fuel for Blake, who&nbsp;learned never to give up.</p><h2>Blake Griffin's Stats</h2><p>Today, as one of the most accomplished NBA players,&nbsp;Blake has some amazing career stats to his name. For instance, from winning&nbsp;four high school state titles&nbsp;at Oklahoma Christian School to being selected as&nbsp;an All-Star in his&nbsp;NBA debut season, Blake&nbsp;scaled his reputation.</p><p>In addition, he was named National college player of the year in 2009 and NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion and NBA Rookie of the Year, both in 2011.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>On March 8, 2021, he was signed by&nbsp;Brooklyn Nets, making his debut for the team&nbsp;on March 21. He&nbsp;logged two points, two rebounds, and a block in 15 minutes of action,&nbsp;in a 113–106 win over the Washington Wizards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqclrimecaroJ%2BemaN6p63MoqOyZZKnvLW0xKtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-james-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris James (footballer)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-morgan-nude-in-sports-illustrated.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Morgan: Nude in Sports Illustrated!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
