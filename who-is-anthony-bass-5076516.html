Others asked why he didn’t clean up the popcorn himself, although it’s unclear if he was on the flight or not, and some former and current flight attendants also gave their thoughts. “A flight attendant is there for safety, not to pick up after you or your children. As a former flight attendant, I speak from experience,” one shared. Despite the backlash, United Airlines also responded to assist further through private messages.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As Anthony continues to receive mixed reactions over his tweet, you can learn more about him and his career below.</p><h2>Anthony is a pitcher with the Toronto Blue Jays.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anthony-bass-5-things-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The professional athlete, who was born in Dearborn, Michigan, has been playing with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the team</a> since 2022.

Anthony’s also the brother-in-law of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jessie’s husband, <strong>Eric Decker</strong></a>, a former NFL wide receiver.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Around the same time Anthony and Sydney began receiving backlash for the former’s post about United Airlines, Jessie reacted about the situation in her own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> message. “My sister @sydneyraebass just texted me from her flight on @united,” she wrote in the message. “As you know, she is five months pregnant, high risk, and also traveling alone with her two small children.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“The flight attendant came up to Sydney with a trash bag, and a wet wipe, telling her the captain wants Syd to clean up every drop,” she continued. “My poor sister is on her hands and knees, crying in the aisle completely humiliated and exhausted, with her children while everyone else watched. Way to go united.”</p><h2>Anthony started playing baseball as a career in college.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anthony-bass-5-things-ss-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>He played for the Wayne State Warriors from Wayne State University, which he attended after high school.

He and his wife, Sydney, shared the news that they are expecting their third child, in cute <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> posts in Feb. and March 2023. One included a video of Sydney telling her oldest daughter about the baby in her “belly,” and another included <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet photos</a> of both of her and Anthony’s two daughters holding a Blue Jays onesie up to the camera.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“The best surprise and miracle we could ever ask for. I still cry thinking about our sweet baby in my belly. Thank you God 🤍😭🙏 Our little miracle baby is due this August,” Sydney captioned one of the posts.</p><h2>Anthony loves to share memorable moments from his life on social media.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>From epic moments on the baseball field to family memories, Anthony has shared several photos and videos from his busy days over the years.
