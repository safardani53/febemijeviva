CHOCOLATE CHIP SANDWICH COOKIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/2017-01-trader-joes-chocolate-824768031.jpg><p>Perhaps getting its inspiration from the iconic <a href=#>Magic Middle cookies</a> that were mysteriously discontinued in the early 2010s, the Trader Joe’s Chocolate Chip Sandwich Cookies boasted the perfect flavor profile for sweets and chocolate lovers.</p><p>The chocolate chip cookie had a delicious layer of fudge in the middle, and shoppers regularly paired the treat with milk for the perfect nostalgic snack.</p><p>Unfortunately, not everything good (or sweet and delicious) can last.</p><p>The cookies were removed from store aisles in 2021, but fans are still angry about their departure from stores.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>“It was criminal to discontinue these cookies,” one cookie lover wrote on Instagram upon hearing the news.</p><p>Another echoed the same outrage: “WHY HAVE THEY DONE THIS TO ME. DID MY DOCTOR CALL THEM?”</p><p>Yet another shared that the cookies were one of a few items that would compel them to wait in the long lines at their local Trader Joe’s store.</p><p>“NOOOOOOOOOOO, of the items that made me wait 30min to go in a TJ's during the past year. This is a tragedy,” another shopper said.</p><h2>2. HONEY BUTTER POTATO CHIPS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/https-twitter-com-snack-memories-824768032.jpg><p>Fans of both sweet and salty snacks constantly looked out for Trader Joe’s beloved Honey Butter Potato Chips.</p><p>They were the best of both worlds, with the sweetness of honey to accompany the salty crunch of your traditional potato chips.</p><p>While it’s been several years since 2018 when the Honey Butter Potato Chips last took up aisle space in stores, the chips clearly took a permanent space in fans’ hearts.</p><p>One fan went to Reddit to complain about the disappearance of “the best chips ever.”</p><p>Petitions have popped up in an effort to get the chips back in stores, but in the meantime, you can buy an alternative with a similar taste called Calbee Honey Butter Chips.</p><p>You can also make your own at home by adding some brown sugar, salt, honey, and butter to your typical potato chips.</p><h2>3. SPICY CHEESE CRUNCHIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/bag-tj-s-spicy-cheese-824767888.jpg><p>Another chip-like snack variation that Trader Joe’s offered was the Spicy Cheese Crunchies.</p><p>The Spicy Cheese Crunchies were Trader Joe’s version of Cheetos, but shoppers loved them because they were entirely gluten-free and baked instead of fried.</p><p>Covered with a spicy cheese dust, the product boasted its “real cheddar cheese and a blend of savory spices” all without any artificial flavors or synthetic colors.</p><p>When customers discovered the fan favorite was missing at stores, they quickly went to the Internet to complain.</p><p>"I am so bummed to know this," one shopper wrote on Reddit in 2022.</p><p>The shopper added: "They were so good and now I'm just sad. Everything I love ends up being discontinued so my luck."</p><p>Another wrote: "Went to a TJs for the first time in a while today. The main reason was for these and I threw a melodramatic fit when I didn't see them on the shelves."</p><h2>4. BARBECUE POPPED RIDGES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/http-www-tastysnacking-com-snacks-824767884.jpg><p>For those who enjoyed a barbecue chip, Trader Joe’s also had the perfect snack for you.</p><p>The Barbecue Popped Ridges were potato and corn puff snacks with a burst of tangy barbecue sauce.</p><p>Even customers who didn’t typically love barbecue were impressed by the unique snack.</p><p>“These chips are surprisingly good,” one customer said in an <a href=#>online review.</a> “I’m really not a BBQ fan at all, including barbeque seasoned or flavored snacks. However, these are some of the best I’ve had.&nbsp;</p><p>“The taste isn’t too over the top, and as the package says it’s a ‘tangy’ rather than overly smokey barbeque flavor. They’re good enough to be a tasty snack, without being so addictive that it was tempting to eat too many at once.”</p><p>However, in 2021, when Trader Joe’s decided to get rid of the item for good, customers were shocked.</p><p>“I love these! They are soo good! Why would they be discontinued?” one shopper commented on Instagram.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Fans are also begging for a <a href=#>beloved fruity drink</a> to reappear in stores after it was discontinued several years ago.</p><p><a href=#>A Pillsbury breakfast favorite</a> also has customers up in arms now that it’s been discontinued.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbYB2hJJxb2icmaiwsLrToqWunZRiwbOtw56pZqKfmsBuv82amqSrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nikki-bella-son-matteo-first-birthday-tribute-pics-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nikki Bella Celebrates Son Matteos First Birthday With Sweet Tribute Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ken-purcell-wikipedia-coaching-legends-age-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Coaching Legend's Age &amp;amp; Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
