Below is everything to know about their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>love life</a>!</p><h2>Janelle & Tessa Thompson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of Janelle’s most known <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumored relationships</a> is with&nbsp;Men in Black 4 star<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Tessa Thompson</strong></a>, 39. The two first sparked romance speculation after Tessa starred in Janelle’s <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>music video</a> “Make Me Feel” in 2018. In the iconic video, Janelle and the 39-year-old had major on-screen chemistry and fans quickly began to think that they were romantically involved.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite the duo’s obvious chemistry in the music video, Tessa later discussed whether or not they were dating during a June 2018 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Net-A-Porter</a>. “It’s tricky, because <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Janelle and I</a> are just really private people and we’re both trying to navigate how you reconcile wanting to have that privacy and space, and also wanting to use your platform and influence,” she said at the time. Although she did not explicitly confirm they were an item, Tessa did declare her love for Janelle. “We love each other deeply. We’re so close, we vibrate on the same frequency,” she noted, before adding, “If people want to speculate about what we are, that’s okay. It doesn’t bother me.”</p><h2>Their Romance With Nate Wonder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Janelle-Monaes-Dating-History-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aside from Janelle’s sparks with Tessa, the&nbsp;Dirty Computer&nbsp;singer was previously linked to musician&nbsp;<strong>Nate Wonder</strong>.

Despite the public cuddling, Janelle and Nate did not ever publicly confirm their romance.</p><h2>Janelle & Lewis Hamilton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Janelle-Monaes-Dating-History-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Another romance under Janelle’s belt was one with British race car driver&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong></a>, 38.
