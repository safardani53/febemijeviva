Ruffalo told PEOPLE in 2019 that balancing acting, his environmental activism and fatherhood isn’t always easy — especially when tackling the hamper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s intense. The times when my wife is gone and I’ve had to take care of everything ... <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the laundry alone is enough to destroy you</a>,” he joked, adding that his wife “is just a hero.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he does have downtime, the actor and his family enjoy snowboarding, cooking and gardening. It’s less about the activity, Ruffalo shared, and more about being together.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mark Ruffalo and his wife, Sunrise Coigney, with their kids at the 'Now You See Me' New York premiere in May 2013.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Astrid Stawiarz/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I like those moments where you’re just chugging along and then, all of a sudden, your kids open up to you, and you have this deep conversation where they express their troubles — it’s hard for them, especially at that age,” he added. “But my kids are way more savvy than I was, man. They’re so engaged in the world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ruffalo has also opened up about having kids with disabilities. In 2015, he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> that all of them have dyslexia and two have ADHD, but their school environment was “upfront about it, accepting, and without shame."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he doesn’t often share photos of his children <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on social media</a>, Keen, Bella and Odette have attended red carpet events with him, including the premieres of Now You See Me in 2013 and Avengers: Endgame in 2019. Those weren't the only times Ruffalo's kids got involved in his career either; all three made brief cameos in 2017’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Thor: Ragnarok</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to his parenting style, the actor has said he tries to be as available as possible. “I’m a very hands-on father. I like being a hands-on father," Ruffalo told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>IndieWire</a> in 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Mark Ruffalo’s children: Keen, Bella and Odette.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keen-ruffalo-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Keen Ruffalo, 22</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mark Ruffalo and his son Keen Ruffalo at Marvel Studios 'She-Hulk: Attorney At Law' Los Angeles premiere on August 2022.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ruffalo and Coigney's</a> oldest child and only son, Keen, was born on June 19, 2001, one year after his parents wed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ruffalo's eldest hasn't quite followed in his father's footsteps yet, but he has dipped his toe in the acting world, making cameos in two of his dad's projects, Begin Again in 2013 and Thor: Ragnarok.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keen also sat beside his dad, mom and youngest sister, Odette, when Ruffalo virtually won best actor at the 2021 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Golden Globe Awards</a> for his dual role in the HBO miniseries <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>I Know This Much Is True</a>.
