At the time, it was met with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>critical acclaim and soared at the box office</a> — becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time at the domestic box office (with a running total of $760.988M) and the sixth-highest-grossing title worldwide (with a running total of $1.8 billion).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although many key details on Spider-Man 4 remain up in the air, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and producer Amy Pascal have opened up about what web heads can expect when Spidey's story continues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything we know so far about Spider-Man 4, including potential plot points and who's likely to return to the cast.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-spider-man-4-about></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is Spider-Man 4 about?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sony Pictures/Marvel Entertainment/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being that Spider-Man 4 is early in early development, an official synopsis hasn't been released. However, assumptions can be made based on the ending of Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the film, fans saw Holland return as Peter Parker and&nbsp;Zendaya as MJ&nbsp;to a world that&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>learned of his superhero identity</a>. Wishing to return to the way things were before everyone knew he was Spider-Man, Peter enlists help from Doctor Strange to change the course of history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At the end of the movie we just made, you see Spider-Man make a momentous decision, one that you’ve never seen him make before," Pascal told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a> in December 2021. "It’s a sacrifice.

When asked explicitly if fans will see Tom as Spider-Man again, Pascal responded: “If I have my way we will.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As long as [Holland] wants to make&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;movies, we will make&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;movies,” she said. “But I’m a producer and I always think everything’s going to work out.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On June 14, Pascal opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about her initial reaction to Holland's performance in the webbed role. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” she told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He inhabited Peter Parker in a way that was completely unique.

However, Sony Chairman Tom Rothman told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deadline</a> in May 2022 that he "hopes" to get "that whole group" in on the next installment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-did-production-on-spider-man-4-start></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When did production on Spider-Man 4 start?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sony Pictures/Marvel Entertainment/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pascal kickstarted the conversation of a fourth Spider-Man film when speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fandango</a> in November 2021, hinting that the recently wrapped trilogy wouldn't be the last fans would see of the Holland and Zendaya-led films.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marvel Studios president Feige gave an update to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a> one month later, also confirming that the fourth film is underway. “Amy [Pascal] and I and Disney and Sony are talking about — yes, we’re actively beginning to develop where the story heads next,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, Feige told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> that a Spider-Man 4&nbsp;script is in the works. “All I will say is that we have the story,” he revealed. “We have big ideas for that, and our writers are just putting pen to paper now.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pascal reiterated that a Spider-Man 4 is underway when speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> on May 31; however, the exact date it commenced is unknown. "Are we going to make another movie? Of course, we are,” she explained. “We’re in the process."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On June 1, Holland also gave Variety an update, though he admitted that he couldn't say too much. “I can’t talk about that, but I can say that we have been having meetings," he told said. “There’s been multiple conversations had, but at this point it’s very, very early stages.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-a-spider-man-4-trailer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is there a Spider-Man 4 trailer?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spider-Man 4 is too early in its development; therefore, a trailer has not been created yet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-will-spider-man-4-premiere></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When will Spider-Man 4 premiere?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sony Pictures/Marvel Entertainment/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the moment, development on this film (and many others) has been put on pause due to the ongoing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>writer's strike</a>.

"We’ve put the meetings on pause in solidarity with the writers,” the Spider-Man actor told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It is uncertain how long the writers strike will last; therefore, a Spider-Man 4 premiere date is up in the air.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-will-spider-man-4-be-the-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Will Spider-Man 4 be the last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Holland and Zendaya's Spider-Man trilogy wrapped and hit theaters in 2021, Pascal confirmed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fandango</a> in November 2021 that the third installment wouldn't be the last fans see of the friendly-neighborhood hero.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel... the last Spider-Man movie," she told the outlet.
