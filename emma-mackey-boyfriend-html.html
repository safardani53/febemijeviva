According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Popsugar magazine</a>, the pair made their relationship Instagram official in January that year.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The pair appeared at multiple events together following the post, including on red carpets.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They were also together at the 2019 Cannes International Series Festival in the South of France. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And as they explored the event, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pair was spotted</a> walking hand-in-hand around the French Riviera. They were even recognized packing on PDA.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Emma Mackey and her then-boyfriend&nbsp;Dam Whitlam at the Cannes&nbsp;Series Festival in 2019. </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Dam Whitlam's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mackey's boyfriend <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted their picture</a> from the event on his Instagram on&nbsp;April 15, 2019. He declared it was his "best ten days," adding a red heart emoji in the caption.&nbsp;</p><p>Their affection for each other is reflected on their social media accounts. Both of them openly updated their fans and followers with their adorable chemistry.&nbsp;</p><p>But it was seemingly never to last. Ergo, the duo broke up and kept the reasons close to their heart.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>While Mackey has deleted all her pictures with&nbsp;Whitlam, he hasn't done so as of this&nbsp;writing.</p><p>And the pair apparently still follow each other on Instagram, which hints that they might have parted on amicable terms.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the reason, Mackey hasn't been invested in any other relationship since then, at least it seems so.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She has neither&nbsp;dropped any hints of being in a relationship on her socials nor sparked any&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>dating rumors</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Emma Mackey's Ideal Boyfriend Qualities&nbsp;</h2><p>Mackey knows the qualities she would prefer in a man on her first date.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Her magazine</a> in January 2020, she discussed her version of&nbsp;dos&nbsp;and don'ts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the beginning, the interviewer asked the stunning actress how she would feel if her supposed date was half-day late because of heavy traffic.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 25-year-old implied she wouldn't mind it. She reasoned she had been in such&nbsp;situations in her real life and stated&nbsp;it was a way to know if their partner loved them.&nbsp;</p><p>She also shared that she wouldn't mind if her date talked about his ex-girlfriends during the conversation. "I think it's cool to be open, talk about," she opined.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Mackey&nbsp;acknowledged she preferred splitting the bill with her boyfriend. She stressed it was a culture everyone should promote.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Besides the thing she would support, the starlet admittedly would never agree to take a picture with a man on their first date.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Mackey wouldn't like her boyfriend to be ordering food for her on their initial dates. She also ruled that&nbsp;the person shouldn't be calling her with just her initials.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2doq5uucCcop6xXZe8urLRopynnF6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grey-s-anatomy-actress-sandra-millionaire-net-worth-salary-2021-what-sandra-doing-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Grey's Anatomy' Actress Sandra Oh Is A Millionaire- Net Worth &amp;amp; Salary In 2022?
