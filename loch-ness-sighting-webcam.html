It kept splashing about.</p><p>"It was quite a size - the size of a boat but it was hard to tell because it was the other side of the loch.</p><p>"I didn't know if I believed in Nessie but this is certainly some Christmas present and quite a surprise."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004083005572.jpg><p>The sighting - the 13th this year - comes just six days after another spotter saw a mysterious creature with a 4ft neck and a head "the size of a rugby ball".</p><p>Ricky Phillips, a British military historian said he was "baffled" by the sight.</p><p>Mr Phillips, 40, also works as a tour guide and was leading a party of eight foreign tourists who went on a cruise on Loch Ness.</p><p>It was as he rested at the River Oich, just as it flows into Loch Ness at Fort Augustus, that Mr Phillips saw the strange sight at 2.40pm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457645704.jpg><p>"It was a grey creature - almost bird like - in a grey stretch of water. It's neck was three to four feet long, a head the size of a rugby ball and a ridge across its eyes," said Mr Phillips.</p><p>"The previous Wednesday I had heard a strange noise as I was stood by a cafe at the edge of the loch in Fort Augustus. The noise sounded almost metallic, but like something was blowing air - like Darth Vader.</p><p>"I have swum and sailed with whales and dolphins, seen hundreds of seals, and it sounded like nothing I have ever heard. I spun around and saw something grey, just a side of a body and a flipper.</p><p>Mr Phillips is adamant it was his second sighting of the fabled beast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457055689.jpg><p>He continued: "Last Thursday after my tour party went on their cruise I decided to take a walk along the river Oich, mainly to see the old bridge, and was taking a few pictures of the loch and the scenery when I again heard that curious noise.</p><p>"I looked up from my phone and saw a long, straight neck, all completely grey, and a narrow face, which was only about 20ft away and then it turned and disappeared all in a few seconds.</p><p>"I looked down and realised that it was in my picture, so zoomed in and there it was. It actually looks like a giant bird or a peacock in the face, with high ridges above its eyes and what almost looks like a beak.</p><p>"I know dinosaurs came from birds and that many had hard lips, almost like a beak - but this is simply what I saw. It seems to have almost a frill on its neck. It is very odd.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN UK NEWS</h2></p><p>"All I will say is that, if I was going to fake a Nessie, I would certainly have made it look less like a bird and more like... well, more like what we think Nessie looks like!"</p><p>Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD.</p><p>Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson.</p><p>The image was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
