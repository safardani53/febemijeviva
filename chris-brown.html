He moved to New York City to pursue music in his early teens, and signed with Jive Records at the age of 15.</p><h2><strong>Career:</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-2>Chris released his self-titled debut album with hit singles “Run It!” and “Gimme That” in 2005. Shortly after, he was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for Best New Artist and Contemporary R&B album. He certainly made a splash in the music industry very quickly, and in the wake of his meteoric rise, he tried his hand at acting. His first role was in the 2006 made for TV movie Christmas in Washington, before he made his big screen debut in musical drama Stomp the Yard alongside fellow R&B singer <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Ne-Yo</strong></a>. He went on to land a series of major screen roles in films like After School, This Christmas, and Phenom. He also made cameos on <a href=#>The O.C. </a>and on Disney Channel’s hit show The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Chris dropped his sophomore album “Exclusive” in 2007, and the first single “Wall to Wall” climbed to the top of the charts, which was quickly followed by his smash hit “Kiss Kiss”. Chris continued gaining notoriety, and gave a standout performance at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, when he took the stage with “Umbrella” songstress <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>. Chris was at his musical peak when he infamously attacked Rihanna on the night of the Grammy Awards in 2009, and was charged with two felonies. His career has never recovered; however he went on to release his fourth album, F.A.M.E in 2011. &nbsp;Chris continued to combine talent with terrible decision-making, releasing hit songs like “Fine China” while getting into <a href=#>altercations</a> with stars like <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Frank Ocean</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>His following albums Fortune, X, Royalty&nbsp;and,&nbsp;Heartbreak on a Full Moon failed to produce any major hits. It wasn’t until he released his ninth studio album Indigo in 2019 that his single <a href=#>“No Guidance”</a> put Chris back on the airwaves, with the song peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. Although he continues to make music and tour, he cannot enter Australia, New Zealand or the United Kingdom due to his criminal history.</p><h2><strong>Personal Life:</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Chris famously began dating fellow singer Rihanna in February 2008, a few months after their performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. They confirmed their couple status while on a romantic vacation in Jamaica, and continued to make headlines as one of the music industry’s most prolific couples. However, on March 5, 2009, on their way to the Grammy Awards, Chris physically attacked Rihanna, and was charged with two felonies: felony assault and making criminal threats. The songstress was left with visible facial injuries and had to be hospitalized. He subsequently plead guilty on June 22 of that year to the charges and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years’ probation and, domestic violence counseling. Chris then made a public apology to Rihanna, which he posted to his official website.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Chris went on to briefly date model <strong>Jasmine Sanders</strong> in 2010, before moving onto <a href=#><strong>Karrueche Tran</strong></a> in late 2011. The couple then split in late 2012, after one year of dating however they rekindled their romance a couple of years later. In 2015, Chris <a href=#>fathered</a> a daughter, <strong><a href=#>Royalty</a></strong>, with another woman&nbsp;<strong>Nia Guzman</strong>, and Karrueche and Chris split again.&nbsp;In Feb. 2017, she got a restraining order against him after he allegedly threatened to kill her. He was later accused of rape by a woman in Paris in Jan. 2018, and was briefly detained. After less than 24 hours, he was released and no lawsuit was filed against him. Chris denied the allegations.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The father-of-one than began <a href=#>dating</a> another model, <strong>Ammika Harris</strong> in 2018. The former couple welcomed a son, <strong>Aeko</strong>, in November 2019 however it isn’t know whether the pair are romantically involved. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the singer has been separated from his young son while he quarantines with his mom on the other side of the world. Chris is unable to make the trip to Germany, where Ammika has been staying with Aeko since January of 2020. Despite the miles between Chris and Ammika, their <a href=#>bond as co-parents</a> remains strong. “Being apart has actually been strengthening their bond because not only has distance made the heart grow fonder, but the physical aspect doesn’t get in the way and they communicate on a really deep level,” a source close to Chris shared with us in July 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When he isn’t posting adorable pics of his baby boy, he’s hanging out with his daughter Royalty, who graduated from kindergarten in May 2020. Photos of her graduation were shared to her Instagram, and the young scholar proudly displayed her diploma in her elementary school’s garden and alongside her teacher. The always&nbsp;<a href=#>stylish Royalty</a> rocked a Versace dress for the big day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Notable Life Moments</strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Chris Brown and Drake have had a fraught relationship, starting in June 2012, when the R&B singers were caught up in a brawl outside a nightclub in NYC.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Though the pair had collaborated together on several songs, a rift allegedly emerged over both of their affections for Rihanna, and on June 14th, their entourages were allegedly involved in a fight that left Chris with a gash on his face, which he posted a picture of on Twitter.
