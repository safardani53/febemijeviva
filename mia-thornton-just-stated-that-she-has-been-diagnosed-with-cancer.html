On February 25, the 37-year-old posted a photo on her Instagram account, describing how she learned about the news and its toll on her and her husband, Gordon Thornton. She said in the post that the doctor told her of the findings of her tests and urged her to go to the Johns Hopkins Cancer Center in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>Thornton said that despite experiencing a ‚Äúblowing amount of emotion‚Äù with her spouse, she has stayed calm, vibrant, and powerful. The Real Housewives of Potomac actress claimed that she had seen experts but that ‚Äúthe storm is not finished.‚Äù Thornton said that the incident affected her, although she has not yet been diagnosed. She took a positive perspective, stating that God has a purpose for her and that she should enjoy each day to the utmost. Mia Thornton‚Äôs friends and fans offered her prayers and best wishes after the news.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mia-Thornton-3.jpg alt="Mia Thornton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter responds to Mia Thornton‚Äôs announcement.</h2><p>Mia Thornton made news in December 2021 after a minor dispute with artist Nicki Minaj, who presented the Real Housewives of Potomac reunion program. During that time, she resorted to social media to criticize the musician for not including her kid in her gift-giving to all of Bravo TV‚Äôs youngsters. Mia Thornton‚Äôs fans and admirers went to Twitter to send their love and prayers to the actress.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Mia-Thornton-2.jpg alt="Mia Thornton" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Thornton, who joined the Potomac cast in the most recent episode of the season, isn‚Äôt the only Housewife to reveal her cancer diagnosis. Camille Grammer-Meyer, a show cast member, announced to People Magazine in 2017 that she had been diagnosed with endometrial cancer in 2013 and squamous cell carcinoma in 2017. Vicki Gunvalson told on Jeff Lewis‚Äô SiriusXM program, Jeff Lewis Live, in November 2021 that she, too, had the condition and had had a hysterectomy to remove her uterus. Nicki soon settled the matter by tweeting that she was nowhere to be found and asking her to submit her address to the singer.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Roommates, let‚Äôs send Mia Thornton from ‚ÄòThe Real Housewives of Potomac‚Äô positive vibes as she revealed she is dealing with health challenges üôèüèΩ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xfsFJ9WOWl</a></p><p>‚Äî TheShadeRoom (@TheShadeRoom) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 25, 2022</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Mia Thornton</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Television star</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikopldqbWwvs2tpqdlmqrAtXnSrZitnZRiwamt02aqoZ1dna60ecGenKdllJ6uqLrOrJydZaeewal5wpqlnJ2iZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bts-jimmy-fallon-un-speech-the-tonight-show-interview-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Reveals U.N.
