and it's not only the vast array of rides and slides that they rave about.</p><p>Unlike most popular theme parks, the Kettering-based business has free entry, with individual tickets for rides selling for just £3.</p><p>For unlimited access, customers can also nab a day wristband that's £22.</p><p>Earlier this month, the park also launched a new addition to its playground - a massive Garden Wheel.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>The 25m-high ferris wheel features 18 gondolas and provides Instagram-worthy views across the leafy countryside.</p><p>According to Wicksteed park, the Garden Wheel is big enough to accommodate up to 72 passengers and the attraction is also included in the price of a wristband.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="FABULOUS FIVER: SPEND £5 AND GET A £25 WELCOME BONUS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FABULOUS FIVER: SPEND £5 AND GET A £25 WELCOME BONUS</a></strong></p><p>For those seeking more thrill, the park operates within four zones - the Adventure zone, the Heritage zone, the Thrill zone, as well as the Splash zone to cool off in the hot <a href=#>weather</a>.</p><p>Families may find it difficult to pick one, as each comes with different attractions, such as Wicky's Farmyard, Lakeside Walks and Water Chute.</p><p>Wicksteed Park also organises a number of events throughout the year - <a href=#>Christmas</a> included - and even their own theatre school that's on Tuesday evenings.</p><p>With so much to offer, the theme park has also become a hit amongst parents, many of whom have shared nothing but positive reviews on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>One twin mum, Sophie, said her tots had ''a lovely day'' exploring the different activities and climbing around the frames.</p><p>''We camped here a few weeks ago, was so good,'' a fellow mum penned.</p><p>''I used to come here at a child…so many childhood memories coming back!'' another wrote.</p><p>''A great place for a day out with children. The staffs are quite friendly, and my son had a good time there,'' a dad wrote on Google.</p><p>''I recommend to buy a wristband if you plan more than 8 rides. The parking is not free, 6 pounds per day.''</p><p>Someone else said the park made for a ''great day out''.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>''Beautiful grounds for picnics and walks and a large play area all free.</p><p>''We got wristbands and they'd paid for themselves within an hour as kids generally wanted to ride things more than once.
