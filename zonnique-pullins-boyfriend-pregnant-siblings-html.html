She went on to pursue her solo music career after the band's split.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Pullins is currently with another musician&nbsp;— rapper Bandhunta Izzy. Not only is she with him, but she is also soon expecting his child. She was seen flaunting her baby bump rather proudly for the world to see. Her pregnancy was also the cause of controversy surrounding her situation with her boyfriend.&nbsp;And if that drama was not enough, Pullins was also caught in a family feud when her step-mother dissed her mother in public.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Zonnique Pullins Can’t Stop Flaunting Her Baby Bump</h2><p>In August this year, Pullins made her pregnancy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official</a> to the whole world by publicly stating about it on her Instagram.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the post, she confirmed that she was indeed pregnant by mentioning a "bundle of joy"&nbsp;with her boyfriend, Badhunta Izzy. Having mentioned that, she said that she was going “back into her corner” as she was a private person and only shared this news when she was ready.&nbsp;</p><p>Pullins seems rather proud of her baby bump as she has often been seen flaunting it proudly.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although this is her first pregnancy, she does seem rather comfortable and ready to overcome what pregnancy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">entailed</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an August issue of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>, Pullins was seen on the cover of the magazine with the baby&nbsp;bump in all its glory.&nbsp;In the same issue, she revealed that she was looking forward to the maturity and responsibility that motherhood brings.&nbsp;It was also revealed that she was five months along. So,&nbsp;doing the math, she should be expecting the baby any day now.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Not all was fine and dandy with Pullins, however. She also revealed that having to deliver a baby in the ongoing pandemic was taking its toll on her. There were times when she had to go to the doctor by herself because the doctors wouldn’t allow her to come with her baby daddy.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Pullins Received A Lot Of Flak For Not Marrying Her Baby Daddy</h2><p>Contrary to what others believe, Pullins is not married to Badhunta Izzy and she likes to keep it that way for the time being. But others in the industry, including her peers and critics, were not so fond of her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">situation</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Right after she went public about her pregnancy, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">critics</a> were quick to slam her for having the baby out of wedlock.&nbsp;</p><p>Pullins spoke in detail regarding this in a now-deleted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hollywoodlife</a> article and covered by Rollingout.com. She said that despite all the criticisms, she was not ready to marry because she felt that she was still too young. She further mentioned that marrying was an even bigger commitment for her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Zonnique having a baby is cool and all. But sis, please make it a goal to get married to Izzy! Izzy already have two other kids by two different women. Please do not let you be the third baby momma. Zonnique to pretty to be a baby mamma, she definitely wifey type. — Nique (@_imsointoyou) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 5, 2020</a></p><p>Judging by her explanation, it is&nbsp;likely that&nbsp;Pullins was feeling quite overwhelmed by the situation and the prospect of a possible marriage with Badhunta Izzy.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Pullins was quickly rescued by her mother, Tiny Harris, after she got caught in the middle of it all. Harris lambasted back by saying that Harris herself wasn’t married when she had Pullins and that didn’t turn out bad after all. In fact, Harris mentioned, that they both were doing great now.</p><h2>Pullins Was Disowned By Her Biological Father</h2><p>Pullins, her mother, her biological dad, and her step-mom were embroiled in a nasty public <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">feud</a> that came to light in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>The feud started when Pullins’ step-mom Cheryl blasted rapper T.I (Pullins’ step-dad) for claiming Pullins’ as his own daughter and how he helped raise her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Not wanting to be outdone, this is when harris jumped back at her. She reminded Cheryl that T.I had been in Pullins’ life since she was 5 years old and even helped pay for her school tuition. She proclaimed that T.I was more of a father to her daughter than her actual dad was. Pullins jumped in the argument too and defended her mom. And this was when Pullins'&nbsp;father, Zonnie ‘Zebo’ Pullins, allegedly disowned her.&nbsp;</p><p>Pullins’ mother Tiny Harris had her in 1996 when she was dating Zonnie Pullins. They then separated two years later after Pullins was born in 1998. But this comes from a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">source</a> that is now deleted, so take this bit of information with some skepticism.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Zonnique Pullins’ Imperfect Family At Age 22</h2><p>Zonnique Pullins was born on 20 March 1996 in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Georgia</a>. Her mother, Tameka Harris is known as Tiny in the music world and relishes her own popularity gained as an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">R&B</a> singer. Zonnique Pullins was initially recognized as the stepdaughter of popular rapper T.I-real name Clifford Harris while her real dad’s name is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zonnie Pullins</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 22 years old shares her parents with six <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">siblings</a>- four brothers Messiah, King, Major, and Domani and two sisters Deyjah and Heiress. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The blue-eyed diva’s family is as flawed as it is big. Her mother, Tiny, and stepdad T.I have been married for many years now but they’ve had shaky grounds in their relationships. Tiny even filed for divorce in early 2016 and separated later that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmLaiuo6zpqemmabCpnnPrqOloZ6oeqO72J%2Bpop2emXqxvsSgpZqmpGLAqq7LoqWgq16dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-widdicombes-wife-rose-hanson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Josh Widdicombe's wife Rose Hanson?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
