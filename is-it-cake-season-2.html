Details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Netflix's latest addition to the baking show genre, <a href=#>Is It Cake?</a>, has all of the typical elements of a cooking competition that fans love. It also has one major and unique twist: the contestants are trying to deceive the judges with their masterpiece cakes.</p><p>The series, which SNL alum <a href=#>Mikey Day</a> hosts, is based on a 2020 TikTok trend, when users would cut into realistic looking everyday objects to reveal that they were actually edible pieces of cake.</p><p>On each episode of the series, three bakers face off to bake and design a cake that resembles a designated item, like a purse, a shoe, or a hamburger. Once the cakes are complete, they are placed in a group with several decoy objects.</p><p>The <a href=#>rotating panel of celebrity judges</a> then have 20 seconds to guess which item is actually cake. The winners can take home cash (if they can differentiate a real jar of money from a cake), and they have the opportunity to continue competing to get to the finale.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Mikey Day, the host of 'Is It Cake?'.</p></figure><p>While the concept of the series is meant to be a bit ridiculous, many fans can't help but root for the uber-talented contestants, and to get involved themselves by attempting to identify the cakes too.</p><p>Those who watched all eight episodes of the first season may be wondering if the Netflix series will return for Season 2.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has 'Is It Cake?' been renewed for Season 2?</h2><p>The debut season of the baking series only dropped on Netflix on March 18, so fans shouldn't be too surprised to learn that the streamer has yet to announce a renewal decision at this time. It could be several months until Netflix publicly announces whether the show will come back or not.</p><p>While it is unclear at this time if Is It Cake? will return for Season 2, there are a few reasons why viewers should be hopeful.</p><p>The show made Netflix's Top 10 list in the United States soon after it debuted on the streamer, and it's even spent time in the #1 spot. Because the set for Is It Cake? already exists, and the panel of judges changes in every episode, it likely would not be too difficult for Mikey and a new set of bakers to commence filming on another season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>The bakers featured on 'Is It Cake?' Season 1.</p></figure><p>The first season has performed well in the immediate days following its release, but that often isn't enough to fully save a series from cancelation. It will be crucial to see how Is It Cake? will continue to perform — and if it will stay on the trending list — within the first month of its debut.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are the bakers featured in the cast of 'Is It Cake?' Season 1?</h2><p>Nine talented bakers made the cut for Is It Cake? Season 1 (<a href=#>though only one was victorious</a>). The contestants, who were able to stump the judges, were Andrew Fuller, Hemu Basu, Sam Cade, Desiree Salaverria, Steve Weiss, April Julian, Justin Ellen, Jonny Manganello, and Nina Maria Charles.</p><p>All eight episodes of Is It Cake? Season 1 are available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButdNmmpqjlWLApq3SqKVmag%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-where-the-challenge-all-stars-2021-is-filmed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heres where The Challenge All Stars 2021 is filmed Fri 12 November 2021 13:52 Updated Fri</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kia-stevens-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Kia Stevens Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
