You say it’s causing damage but the government agencies say it is not any threat or danger to a child to have their ears pierced.”</p><p>But Alley jumped in with: “Do you support female genital mutilation?”</p><p>When Raj answered “Absolutely not”, Alley retorted:&nbsp; “Then how you can allow your child to have its ears pierced when there’s no medical reason to have that done?</p><p>Raj said: “Calling it child abuse is ridiculous. Have you Googled child abuse?</p><p>Alley replied: “It’s inflicting unnecessary pain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ears-studio.jpg><p>Mum-of-two Raj told hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby her daughter had felt no pain.</p><p>She said: “She wanted it done. If she felt any pain we would have stopped.</p><p>“She’d been asking for a long time to have it done and it’s part of our culture.</p><p>“It’s a huge thing and we go out and but jewellery together, we have jewellery made together and she’s seen this growing up and she’d been asking for a long time.”</p><p>Alley told her: “If I had a dog, and I brought him into this studio with both ears pierced I would be ostracised, and rightly so. So why do that to a child?”</p><p>Raj argued: “My child had her ears pierced at five and she’s had no problems. She had her aftercare kit and she’s looked after them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404377752.jpg><p>Phillip reminded Alley: “You compared claiming it was “cultural thing to being like Adolf Hitler.”</p><p>Alley said: “Why would you inflict pain on your child?”</p><p>In a poll at the end of the show, 32 per cent of viewers said it was OK to pierce a child’s ears but 68 per cent said it wasn’t acceptable.</p><p>Viewers were split with one tweeting:&nbsp; “No ear piercing until a child becomes a teenager!”</p><p>Another added: “My daughter got hers pierced at 5, her nose and belly button at 14... it’s hardly bloody child abuse ..it’s a piercing.</p><p>“Bloody do gooders. Raise your kids how you see fit and the rest of us can do the same.”</p><p>But many were angry at the reference to FGM in the debate.</p><p>Placid Madness wrote: “The moment the woman compared piercing ears to FGM she lost the argument end of.”</p><p>Happygnome added: “Trying to compare FGM to ear piercing you stupid woman!”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Earlier this month, This Morning viewers were shocked when a<a href=# rel=noopener> Rich Kids Go Skint star, 22,</a> admitted she'd never washed up.</p><p>A <a href=# rel=noopener>mum recently sparked the debate on ear piercing</a> by asking if she should let her four-year-old have it done.</p><p>Previously a mum was&nbsp;accused of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>‘child abuse’ after video of baby having her ears pierced sparks outrage on Facebook.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Vram5xYmt8qr%2BMqaCeqpOeu6h5wGarqJyUobKzv4yemKurXZi1qrjDZpibraOaerW0yKxkpqeio7avs4yvoJ6vlafAbrLUq6CoraNivLex0WabnpqRqbJuw8eimqFlo5bEbrvNnmSmrZ1isLC5z5qpnmWZqXq1u4yfnqZlkaOxbrzInqmcoZ6ceqJ5w6ierGWVlr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-mcphee-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John McPhee (footballer)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-kobe-bryant-celebrity-beef.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Drake and Kobe Bryant beef explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
