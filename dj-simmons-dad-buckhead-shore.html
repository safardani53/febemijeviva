We're sure there's a joke in there somewhere, but let's just focus on the latter of the three, <a href=#>DJ Simmons</a>.</p><p>His father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daryl Simmons</a>, is known for producing and writing music for tons of A-list musicians. As DJ told Distractify exclusively, he hopes to follow in his father's footsteps someday.</p><p>DJ also opened up to us about making music with one of his co-stars and trying to concentrate on his craft while filming a reality show at a noisy lake house. As is to be expected, it's not all that easy.</p><p>Buckhead Shore focuses on DJ and his group of friends as they spend another summer at one of their lake houses, as they'd done for years before the show began. Except now, DJ and the rest of the gang are letting the world in on their shenanigans.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @daryllsimmons</a><p>Daryl Simmons, Mike Epps, and Babyface</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Buckhead Shore' star DJ Simmons says his dad is a big part of why he wants a career in music.</h2><p>Daryl is a big-time record producer and recording artist himself. He even won a Grammy in 1993 as one of the writers of the Boyz II Men song "End of the Road." Additionally, Daryl has been nominated for five other Grammys in the Best R&B category.</p><p>DJ told us that he recognizes his father's success and he would like the same for himself as a musician.</p><p>"I'm a songwriter as well, trying to follow in his footsteps," DJ shared. " At the same time, I'm talented as hell. And I'm dope as hell. Me and Pat [Muresan, of Buckhead Shore] have worked on music as well. We're just trying to figure it out, you know, the process of everything.
