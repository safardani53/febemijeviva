She said: “I think he might take long walks because maybe my matches stress him out.”</p><p>And yes her father is the man behind all her success.</p><p>Here is what she said concerning Leonard Francois’ job, which is training them: “When I was growing up, my mum always worked, my mother was working a lot because my dad was always with us. He was the one who was our coach.”</p><p>To ensure that there was a total commitment to training his daughters to be superstars, he did not send them to school.

This was as per the Japanese Family Registration Law (Koseki).</p><p>However, the girls demanded their father to live together, and later Tamaki’s family agreed.</p><p>After the reunion, they moved back to the USA, where Naomi Osaka’s father, Leonard Francois, continued training them to play tennis.
