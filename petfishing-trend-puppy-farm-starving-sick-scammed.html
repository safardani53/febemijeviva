We saw three puppies, and the dogs they said were the litter’s mum and dad.</p><p>“We fell in love with Max. He went straight to my son and curled up on his lap - he chose us.”</p><p>Despite all the positive signs, unbeknown to Rebecca and her family, it all turned out to be lies.</p><p>In fact, Max wasn’t a Cavapoo at all and was instead a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel/ Bichon Frise cross - a fact found out later after a DNA test.</p><p>It also turned out he was just five weeks old - far too young to be separated from his mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000568543167-e1585141884870.jpg><p>The family paid a £100 deposit for the £475 pup, and agreed to pick him up a week later once they’d returned from holiday.</p><p>“He was very quiet initially, which we put down to being taken away from his environment and missing his mum," Rebecca says.</p><p>However, just 17 hours later, Max’s life was in danger.</p><p>“My husband rang me and said I needed to get home and Max was basically on his last legs - he’d collapsed and couldn’t even lift his head," Rebecca says.</p><p>"He was just like a rag and we were warned he might not survive the night. It was awful.”</p><p>He stayed on a drip for 18 days in total while the vets carried out tests.</p><p>“He couldn’t keep any food down or anything," Rebecca adds.

"I didn’t question paying the money - from the day I had that puppy in my hands I knew I would do everything I could for him.”</p><p>Eventually, Max was diagnosed with megaesophagus - a hereditary condition in which the dog's oesophagus doesn't function properly and prevents it from swallowing food.</p><p>“It was worse than having a baby - we had to feed him liquidised food every two to three hours then wind him to burp. We had to do this for six months," Rebecca says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000570085432.jpg><p>Sadly, it transpired Max had been puppy farmed by a gang who were later prosecuted - they’d made £2million before being caught.</p><p>“After Max was ill I text the breeder twice and he replied once, but after that they stopped replying and wouldn’t answer my calls," Rebecca says.</p><p>“I felt angry - we’d been fooled but it turned out they were professionals who’d been doing this for years”.</p><p>At eight months Max underwent an op, with vets cutting from the shoulder blade to the chest, to repair his oesophagus, and thankfully he has gone on to make a full recovery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000568544603-e1583927086177.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000568544600-e1583927196285.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000568544589.jpg><h2>‘I had to have my five-week kitten put down’</h2><p>Shop manager Amy Heathcote, 31, from Southend, Essex, bought her kitten Marley in July 2019, but tragically had to have him put down just a week later when he was just five weeks old.</p><p>“I’d always been brought up with pets, and already had two cats when I saw Marley advertised on Gumtree," she says.
