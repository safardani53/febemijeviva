It’s not clear where they were going, but there appeared to be stores surrounding them, indicating they were running errands or possibly getting food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-daughter-daisy-mega-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Both Orlando and Katy looked stylishly comfortable as they took their family-of-three stroll. He wore a light peach-colored hoodie, jeans, and tan sneakers with white shoelaces while she showed off a khaki style button-down long-sleeved top, matching pants, and tan slip-on sandals with matching socks. She also had a tan headband over her blonde locks, which were pulled back, and a pink floral face mask as her hunky love rocked his own bright blue face mask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-daughter-daisy-mega-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The outing comes during Katy’s first Mother’s Day weekend and one person walking by them was even spotted holding a “Happy Mother’s Day” balloon. Although she hasn’t revealed whether or not she has any plans for the special day, which takes place on May 9, she’ll most likely be relishing in the fact that she’s now the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>proud mom</a> of little Daisy. Since the tot’s arrival last summer, she’s been seen enjoying quality time with her and often boasts about her in interviews and on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Last Oct., Katy also gushed over Orlando and how he’s been bonding with his new baby girl. “Daddy’s doing a great job,” she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told ET </a>in an interview about her return as a judge on American Idol. “Daddy has stepped in. I’ve seen the Bjorn on him, I’ve seen him with the bottle, I’ve seen all the pictures. It’s all good.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She also explained that although she adored Daisy, she’s “grateful” for having an opportunity to still be on the music competition series. “It’s amazing. I’m so grateful for this opportunity and for this job, and to be able to continue to inspire other people to go after their dreams,” she explained. “I mean, my life just feels very full and whole.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e49xZqiqnJa7pbuMm6Oop51itbC4w6xknZmlnLW1sdFmm5qho656rK3TsmSpnaKnxm65zq2fnqqjYrGixYywnJ6jlaOxbrzInKpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./orlando-bloom-was-surprised-by-nude-paddle-boarding-photos-w476328.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Orlando Bloom Was Surprised by Nude Paddle Boarding Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-conway-dies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carol Burnett Show Star Dies at 85</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
