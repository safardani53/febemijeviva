Dr Aslam advises checking with your GP before starting new supplements – and leaving two hours between taking meds and vitamins.</li></ul><h2 class=has-text-align-center>IMMUNE BOOST</h2><p><strong>VITAMIN A:</strong>&nbsp;Essential for healthy immune function, vitamin A bolsters the body’s first line of defence, such as the lining of the gut, that can trap nasty bacteria.</p><p>It promotes growth in children, good skin and, says Dr Aslam, is crucial “for maintaining good eyesight, particularly for adaptation to darkness and for the health of the retina (at the back of the eye)”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000850516234.jpg><p><strong>FOR</strong>: Most people get enough through their diet (dairy, oily fish and eggs are good sources).</p><p>But the Government recommends kids aged six months to five years take daily supplements containing vitamins A, C and D.</p><p><strong><a href=#>VITAMIN C</a></strong>:&nbsp;As an antioxidant, vitamin C is crucial for immune function.</p><p>It helps drive immune cells to the site of bugs – as well as supporting healthy bones, teeth and blood vessels.</p><p><strong>Dr Aslam says</strong>: “Vitamin C may have a role in protecting against the common cold.”</p><p>Studies have also linked vitamin C to the prevention of cancer, heart disease, cataracts, diabetes and Parkinson’s.</p><p><strong>FOR:</strong> Those whose diet isn’t great. Dr Aslam says: “Poor intake is a risk in people who do not eat enough fruit and vegetables, which may include low- income households and over-65s, particularly those in care institutions.”</p><p>Sources include citrus fruits, berries, peppers and tomatoes.</p><p><a href=#>ZINC:</a> This helps fight off bacteria and viruses, and manages inflammation.</p><p><strong>Dr Sarah Brewer, nutritionist, author and founder of Origins, says</strong>: “It’s essential for growth during pregnancy, infancy and childhood.”</p><p>Zinc acetate lozenges may help deal with the common cold. There is also some evidence that zinc can help with male fertility.</p><p><strong>FOR: <a href=#>Vegans and vegetarians</a></strong> appear at greater risk of deficiency.</p><p>For those who eat little red meat, shellfish and dairy products offer a zinc boost.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ENERGY BOOST</h2><p><strong>B VITAMINS</strong>: If you are feeling low in energy, B vitamins are among the first port of call.</p><p><strong>Dr Aslam explains</strong>: “They help enzymes in the body break down carbohydrates to produce energy and transport nutrients.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/medicine-container-iron-mineral-supplement-850516498.jpg><p>“They work together to keep our nervous system and brains running properly.”</p><p><a href=#>Vitamin B12</a> helps energy production, reduces tiredness and fatigue and helps make red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body.</p><p><strong>FOR</strong>: Over-50s and those following a plant-based diet, as B vitamins are most abundant in meat, fish and eggs.</p><p><strong>MAGNESIUM</strong>: Converts the food you eat into energy. It may also promote sleep, which can help fight tiredness.</p><p><strong>Dr Brewer says</strong>: “Magnesium is vital for the nervous system, muscle movement and the formation of healthy bones and teeth.</p><p>"It is also involved in the process important for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction and normal heart rhythm.”</p><p><strong>FOR</strong>: People who eat a lot of processed food.</p><p>Switch white bread and milk chocolate for wholemeal bread and dark chocolate. Both are easy sources of magnesium.</p><p><strong><a href=#>IRON</a></strong>: Around one in four teenagers, and one in five women, are at risk of iron deficiency anaemia, which can leave you pale and low on energy.</p><p><strong>Dr Brewer says</strong>: “Iron is important for making haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen around the body.</p><p>“Iron is also essential for maintaining a healthy immune system.”</p><p>FOR: Most of us get our iron from red meat, so vegetarians should stock up on beans and chickpeas.</p><p>Dr Brewer adds: “Women with <a href=#>heavy periods</a>, or who feel tired all the time, may benefit from a blood test to see if they need an iron supplement.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>MOOD BOOST</h2><p><strong><a href=#>VITAMIN D</a></strong>: Everyone feels a little more gloomy when there is less sunshine – and that may be because the body cannot make vitamin D without the sun’s rays.</p><p>Researchers in <a href=#>Finland</a> have found taking vitamin D can help alleviate symptoms of depression.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/five-bottles-drink-yogurt-gray-850516917-1.jpg><p><strong>Dr Aslam says</strong>: “Vitamin D helps the body to absorb and use calcium and phosphorus, both essential for maintaining strong and healthy bones and teeth, as well as other body functions such as heart and muscle function.”</p><p><strong>FOR</strong>: Everyone is recommended to take a daily vitamin D supplement of at least 10mcg during autumn and winter, when lack of sunlight makes it harder for our bodies to produce it.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PROBIOTICS</a></strong>: Science has shown that the gut and brain are connected, and there is some evidence that healthy gut bacteria can have a positive effect on mental wellbeing.</p><p>While there needs to be more research, probiotics may also support our immune system, plus brain and heart health.</p><p><strong>Dr Aslam says</strong>: “Probiotics such as acidophilus and bifidus are consumed to improve digestion.</p><p>“Once in the gut, they work by multiplying and restoring the balance of the normal bacterial population of the intestine.”</p><p><strong>FOR</strong>: Anyone concerned about immune and gut health.</p><p>Increase probiotics in your diet with un-sweetened yoghurt for breakfast, and cut back on sugar.</p><p><strong><a href=#>SELENIUM</a></strong>: Important for keeping your immune system ticking along nicely. Dr Brewer reveals that selenium also prevents damage to cells and tissues.</p><p>This can help reduce risk of <a href=#>cancer</a>, <a href=#>heart disease</a> and thyroid disease.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><strong>FOR</strong>: One in two women, and one in four men, are lacking in selenium.</p><p>Fish, meat and Brazil nuts are rich sources.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">ARE YOU DUE A COVID TOP-UP JAB?</h3></p><p>FEWER than one in three people know who is eligible for the latest NHS Covid booster, says a poll by research group Ipsos.</p><p>Autumn rollout began last month, as did flu vaccinations.</p><p>People over 65 years, living with certain health conditions or living in residential care can get free jabs, among others eligible, outlined on the NHS website.</p><p>Parents should check their child’s red vaccination book to make sure they are up to date with doses, as jab rates are at a record low.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgJJsaWtvZ2TDqsDApqCnq12itq%2Bx0ZqjrGWSpLy0wIyipKatnpp6tMXSrZymZaeeu7Wx0WaZnqaVm7a1v44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cwczhyeazx0ge7xqkubbvnekrwmvezmo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Criminal Minds Season 16 Episode 10: Dead End</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sudoku-puzzle-creator-maki-kaji-dies-of-cancer-at-69.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sudoku Puzzle Creator Maki Kaji Dies of Cancer at 69</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
