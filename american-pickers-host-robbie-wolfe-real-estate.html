estate net worth of approximately $3,467,300.&nbsp;</p><p>The empire includes <a href=#>four mansions and 11 commercial properties</a>.</p><p>Robbie has made 98 appearances on American Pickers since 2010, according to IMDB. &nbsp;</p><p>The History Channel officially replaced Frank with Mike’s brother Robbie in cast photos and on the website ahead of Season 23, which premiered earlier this month.</p><h2>FRANK'S FIRING</h2><p><a href=#>Frank</a>, 57, last appeared on&nbsp;American Pickers&nbsp;during a March 2020 episode, as he took time off to recover from back surgery.</p><p>The original cast member’s firing was announced in July despite him expressing his desire to return to the History show.</p><p>Frank left the show to recover&nbsp;<a href=#>from grueling back surgery</a>&nbsp;that left him with 185 stitches and two rods in his spine.&nbsp;</p><p>During his time off the show,&nbsp;<a href=#>Frank lost 65 pounds</a>, as he is living a healthier lifestyle and is sober from alcohol.</p><p>Frank also told The Sun that he&nbsp;<a href=#>checked into rehab for alcohol abuse</a>&nbsp;in Iowa for 77 days.</p><p>Frank said last year: “I went to rehab and I’ve been sober now for 11 months.</p><p>“I didn’t like drinking anymore. My mom was an alcoholic and she died five years ago and it was alcohol-related. My grandfather was an alcoholic and he died. That didn’t sit well with me.”</p><p>Frank continued that he goes to meetings "twice a week” after the stint.</p><p>Frank said he would’ve been sober for a year if it weren't for a relapse.&nbsp;</p><p>He added: "It was maybe for four hours, but it was enough. The next day&nbsp;I went to a meeting and I got right back on track.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ll ever have a drink again because I don't like the feeling anymore and some of the dumb things that I did.”</p><p>Frank continued: “I’m feeling really good. Life is good and I’d like to get back into the swing of things.&nbsp;I wish I had done it five years ago, I would have been a different person.</p><p>“It was the best thing for me and I wish I had done it sooner or I wouldn’t be in the position that I am right now.”</p><h2>PICKERS FEUD</h2><p>Frank also&nbsp;<a href=#>revealed his feud with costar Mike</a>, 57.</p><p>Frank previously told The Sun of their falling out: “I haven’t talked to Mike in two years.&nbsp;He knew my back was messed up, but he didn’t call me up and ask how I was doing. That’s just how it is.</p><p>"The show is tilted towards him 1,000 percent. I can’t even bend that far down to show you how much.&nbsp;</p><p>"That’s fine. It’s like you’ve got Aerosmith and there’s Steven Tyler and he’s the frontman.&nbsp;I found my spot, I’m second and he’s number one on the show. That’s no problem with me, maybe he does have a problem.”</p><p>He even admitted: “I think Mike wants to get his brother Robbie in there to replace me.&nbsp;I don’t know why he’s behaving like that towards me.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The Sun exclusively reported that even though&nbsp;<a href=#>ratings were still above 1 million viewers</a>, the numbers <a href=#>dropped for the season premiere</a> compared to previous seasons.</p><p>Fans have even boycotted the show because of Frank’s firing, as many have dubbed Robbie “boring.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703679363-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000666254589.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZGmEeIWTaJimnaKesKK6jKmgnKOVp8ButM6sq2aqn5evqrGMsKalnpViv6aty2acrKyRqbJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-berry-actor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | David Berry (actor) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thali-garcias-husband-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thali Garcias Husband: Who is Thali Garcia Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
