It's something I experienced as early as elementary school when other kids would randomly walk up to me and ask me if I "<a href=#>got beef</a>." I had no idea what in the world they were referring to. What did meat have to do with school? And why were they being so aggressive when they asked me if I had any?</p><p>Thanks to MTV's extensive coverage of East-Coast-West-Coast hip hop rivalries, I quickly came to understand what having "beef" means. And thankfully, the answers to new acronyms are now easily found on the internet. So if you've been browsing <a href=#>Snapchat</a> and have seen the term "MBN" going around, we've got you covered on what it means.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does "MBN" mean on Snapchat?</h2><p>It's short for "must be nice." And if you're wondering if that's a genuine commentary or a passive-aggressive one, it's definitely the latter. So, how would one go about even using this acronym when reacting or commenting on a post?</p><p>It's probably best embodied by the song "Tulum," posted by musician, TikToker, and YouTuber Emoney. The track poses the very important question of how so many people are ending up in the beautiful Mexican vacation destination.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In "Tulum," Emoney encapsulates the "must be nice" mentality as he painfully serenades listeners with the relatable, befuddled pangs of seeing beautiful individuals with no tangible source of self-sustaining income living a multi-millionaire lifestyle of luxury as he sits at home crafting songs about his jealousy over their good fortune.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@its__kenziee href=#>@its__kenziee</a><p>Mbnnüò≠ <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=single href=#>#single</a> <a title=xyzbca href=#>#xyzbca</a> <a title=goviral href=#>#goviral</a> <a title=relationships href=#>#relationships</a> <a title=mbn href=#>#mbn</a> <a title=dontleaveme href=#>#DontLeaveMe</a> <a title=awh href=#>#awh</a> <a title=duet href=#>#duet</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Heart broken - ùñòùñçùñäùñäùñäùñäùñäùñòùñç" href=#>‚ô¨ Heart broken - ùñòùñçùñäùñäùñäùñäùñäùñòùñç</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@barbie.plugxo href=#>@barbie.plugxo</a><p>mbn ü•∫ <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=romantic href=#>#romantic</a> <a title=love href=#>#love</a> <a title=romanticdecoration href=#>#romanticdecoration</a> <a title=rosepetals href=#>#rosepetals</a> <a title=relationship href=#>#relationship</a> <a title=mbn href=#>#mbn</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Retro Toküì∫" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Retro Toküì∫</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"MBN" isn't just used on Snapchat; it's shorthand used on many platforms.</h2><p>You'll definitely see the term "MBN" on various comments sections or even when you're just texting with your pals. We all have that one friend who's a bit "woe is me" and is always down in the dumps, like Eeyore.</p><p>So, what are some examples of "MBN" used in a conversation or comment that don't have to do with Tulum? Let's say someone just got a great promotion at work or was able to secure an awesome job opportunity while you're stuck in a rut or at a place you really don't like working. You can rattle off "MBN" to them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@brygabbana2.0 href=#>@brygabbana2.0</a><p><a title=greenscreenvideo href=#>#greenscreenvideo</a> <a title=DontSpillChallenge href=#>#DontSpillChallenge</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=blowthisup href=#>#blowthisup</a> <a title=mbn href=#>#mbn</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Here Comes the Boy - Felix Gabriel" href=#>‚ô¨ Here Comes the Boy - Felix Gabriel</a></figure><p>The true significance of "MBN" depends a lot on the context. Usually, the person who's rattling off the acronym is insinuating that the recipient isn't necessarily deserving of whatever "nice" thing they're currently enjoying. Did your friend get themselves a brand new Tesla as a graduation gift from their parents? Well, that "must be nice."</p><p>But if that one friend worked their butt off, saved their money, and worked assiduously every single day to attain whatever it is that you're jealous of, well then, your "must be nice" is a little gross and says more about you than about your friend. It doesn't take into account all of the sacrifices that individual made in order to get whatever thing they acquired, which is symbolic of their hard work and dedication.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaKvr3nMnpinZZ%2BjerS6wKmaoZmk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-michael-auger-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Michael Auger Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sadboyprolific.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Sadboyprolific</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
