He was born to a Vietnam War veteran father, Vernall Varnado, and mother, Beverly Broadus.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Three months after Snoop Dogg was born, Varnado left the family. As a result, Beverly married Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. The rapper was named after his stepfather.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Snoop Dogg was interested in music from a young age.

He started when he was in sixth grade and used to entertain his schoolmates.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This gave traction to Snoop Dogg’s career as a rapper.&nbsp;</p><h2>Snoop Dogg's Career&nbsp;</h2><p>His solo tapes of freestyle made their rounds around the area. They eventually fell into the hands of Dr. Dre.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Dr. Dre, too, had been gaining momentum for himself at the time. He then called Snoop Dogg for an audition.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, the rapper officially started his professional career in 1992. Previously he used to go by the names of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Snoop Lion before finally settling down for Snoop Dogg.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper has released 18 studio albums, 16 compilation albums, five collaborative albums, 25 mixtapes, and three extended plays.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Similarly, he has released 63 singles and 16 promotional singles.

The duo has faced a lot of difficulties in their relationship. Regardless, they have stuck by each other’s side.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>The pair got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> on June 12, 1997, and share three kids. However, after almost eight years of marriage, the rapper filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, Snoop Dogg regretted asking for a divorce and blamed the music industry for leading him to make that decision. He claimed he was blinded by the fame that came with being a hip-hop icon.&nbsp;</p><p>Filled with guilt, Snoop Dogg tore the divorce papers and vowed he would never ask for one again. Then, he realized he made a mistake and did everything to get the love of his life back.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Snoop Dogg has cheated on Shante a couple of times. Because of this, their marriage has never been the same.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rapper shares a son with Laurie Helmond outside wedlock.

However, Snoop Dogg and Shante stayed strong and made fun of the situation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>Shante also stayed by the rapper during his ‘pimping phase.’ In 2013, Snoop Dogg admitted he used to provide celebrities and athletes with women for entertainment.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, he never used to take money for procuring. He just did it for the sheer fun of it. So Shante let him do his thing and waited for him regardless of all the scandals.&nbsp;</p><p>Shante knows that being in a long-term relationship has its ups and downs. On April 18, 2019, she took to Instagram to let her followers know such relationships come with forgiveness and understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>The high school sweethearts love has stayed strong after all the rumors and scandals surrounding them. On Jan. 12, 2008, after a decade of their marriage, the couple renewed their vows.&nbsp;</p><p>The ceremony was conducted in Charlie Wilson's 20-acre ranch as a surprise for Shante.
