But she forwent the oxygen tank in 2004 as she asked a jury to spare Scott from the death penalty, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Los Angeles Times</u></a> reported at the time.</p><p>“We feel like we’re just shells in front of you, coming here every day, nothing left inside of us,” she told the jury during that penalty phase. “I really feel if you were to take Scott away from us … They were like family, Laci, Conner and Scott. It would be a whole family wiped off the face of the Earth.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lee Peterson, Scott’s father, is still alive and still affected by the case.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: Dr. Phil/YouTube</span></figure><p>Janey Peterson, the wife of Scott’s brother Joe, gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Modesto Bee</u></a> a hint about her father-in-law’s mental state in a 2018 interview, in which she maintained that Scott was guilty of adultery but not murder.</p><p>When asked how Lee was holding up, she composed her thoughts for 35 seconds before responding. “I don’t know if you can understand how Lee is holding up unless you understand the [gravity] of this injustice,” she said, finally. “As much as us kids feel it, I don’t know if I can put myself in Lee’s shoes as a parent, or in Jackie’s shoes. Or in [Laci’s mother] Sharon’s shoes. I just can’t even comprehend it.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Janey spoke to the Bee from the family’s crate-building shop in Poway, Calif., which Lee founded in 1975.
