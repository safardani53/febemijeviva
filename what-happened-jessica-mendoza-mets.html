Jessica, who was both a special advisor for the <a href=#>New York Mets</a> and an ESPN analyst, was criticized for some comments she made about the <a href=#>Astros</a>.</p><p>It's speculated that this is why Jessica has now made her next move in the sports world. If you're not up to date, here's what happened.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Jessica Mendoza? Here's why she left her position with the Mets.</h2><p>Jessica found herself facing massive backlash after making some negative comments about the Astros' sign-stealing system. The comments came after MLB released a nine-page investigation into the incident.</p><p>She publicly criticized Astros' pitcher Mike Fiers for taking the allegations to The Atlantic, forcing MLB to conduct the investigation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“To go public, yeah, it didn’t set well with me,” Jessica said to host Mike Golic. “And honestly, it made me sad for the sport that that’s how this all got found out. This wasn’t something that MLB naturally investigated.”</p><p>The comments brought about criticism as to whether Jessica was speaking as an analyst of ESPN or as an advisor for the Mets.</p><p>Her dual roles have been a constant problem for Jessica, as many wondered if she could be completely objective in her work at ESPN while having stakes in the Mets, or if her job at ESPN would negatively affect her work with the Mets.</p><p>In response to the backlash, Jessica has decided to step down from her position as a special advisor for the baseball team to take on a new position at ESPN. Mets' General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> a statement claiming the decision was so she could "focus more on those new responsibilities."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We are happy for Jessica Mendoza who will be expanding her role at ESPN.

"We are excited for her expanded role at ESPN and fully understand and support her need to fully invest her time in all the new platforms. We have such respect and value her baseball insight and know her impact on the game of baseball is just beginning."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, Jessica also will no longer be an analyst on Sunday night baseball but will shift to other responsibilities, including calling weekday games.</p><p>It's unclear if this ongoing conflict of interest and the comments is why Jessica has shifted her role, as she has yet to publicly comment on the statement.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What softball team did Jessica play for?</h2><p>Before starting her career as a sports analyst, Jessica was a professional softball player.
