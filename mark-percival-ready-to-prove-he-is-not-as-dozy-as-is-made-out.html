They probably see me as a bit thick but I am not that thick, I am just chilling, that is me.</p><p>“Nothing really winds me up, but the flies around Perth and Fremantle are winding me up the most. They keep coming at you, they don't stop keep flying at your head!”</p><p>Percival, 23, has another reason to be angry, the fact his girlfriend Carys flew back to the UK yesterday after spending time with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/percivalm-16111311.jpg><p>But his frustrations at not playing will be eased when he takes to the field this morning.</p><p>Percival added: “We had a few days off so I enjoyed the sights with Carys and her brother.</p><p>“I really appreciate that she took the time off from university, where she studies Spanish and French.</p><p>“But she has had to go back for work reasons.</p><p>“It is not really frustrating to not be picked. Wayne Bennett has picked a 24-man squad for a reason so I am enjoying it, training and watching the others play. We are all part of the same team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/percivalm-16111312.jpg><p>“I’ve been learning off the best coach in the world and trying to improve and now to get the chance and try and take it. Looking forward to getting out there.</p><p>“Wayne told me at the mid-season Test against Samoa what I need to work on and I have kept that in mind and been trying to do that. I’m now looking forward to doing a job for him.”</p><p>Percival comes in along with Kevin Brown, Scott Taylor and Mike McMeeken, meaning all 24 players will have appeared in the group games.</p><p>But even though he has not been able to take to the field, it does not mean he has picked anything up or learned anything from coach Bennett or players like James Graham and Sam Burgess.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wayne-bennett-3.jpg><p>Showing he can adapt from rainy Sydney to scorching Perth has been just one of his tasks.</p><p>“It is watching the way they prepare for games, the likes of James and Sam are very switched on and focussed,” he admitted.</p><p>“They get the job done no matter who they are playing. It is their focus and that is what I have learned, there’s been a lot about myself as well.</p><p>“You come into training sessions and you cannot slacken off, you have got to be focussed in everything you're doing.&nbsp; That's what I have learned off them the most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000362952668-e1509719350487.jpg><p>“It has been different everywhere we have gone but it’s going to be a lot tougher with the heat but hopefully we can get the job done no matter what the weather.</p><p>“I have been spectating last couple of weeks and I’m a bit of both, a good watcher and a bad watcher.</p><p>“It would have been nice to play but I was just loving supporting the lads. It is 24-man squad for a reason and we're all part of it whether you’re playing or not.</p><p>“We have got to play our part. We have to play against the lads and give them the best opposition that we can to prepare if we’re not playing.</p><p>“We are all part of the same team. If you’re not playing you still have your bit to do, but it’s nice to be part of it.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">TOP RUGBY LEAGUE STORIES</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZIF5hZVpbmpnnZa%2FrHnPnqmcoaaWuW6%2BxJqbsmWkpHqxvs6vnGaglWK2tHnNqKtmmaNisbDG2GaYrGWZqHqurcOeZKitpGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./myles-pollards-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Myles Pollards Wife: Who is Myles Pollard Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./glynnis-oconnor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Glynnis OConnor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
