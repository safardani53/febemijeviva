Genius.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000515101678-e1567676666833.jpg><h2>BEN STOKES</h2><p>If his performances in the World Cup final and the recent third Ashes test are anything to go by, Stokes is full of bravado and pomp.</p><p>Therefore, a lion tat is <a href=#>fitting for a man who single-handedly saved England from a mauling by the Aussies</a>.</p><p>His lions cover his entire back... it must've taken ages to do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000518884856-e1567676732769.jpg><p>The African Lion symbolises mastering your emotions..."</p><span class=quote-credit>Lewis Hamilton</span><h2>LEWIS HAMILTON</h2><p>The F1 ace doesn't usually show off his tats, <a href=#>often seen just sat in a car</a> covered in racing attire.</p><p>However, when he's enjoying some downtime - normally on the beach - you'll see his upper body covered in ink.</p><p>And it's his lion tat on his shoulder, designed by New York artist Keith “Bang Bang” McCurdy, that he's most proud of.</p><p>He wrote on Instagram: "The African Lion symbolises mastering your emotions... The African lion roars ferociously and the roar can be heard for miles... It is summoning the power of the sun to be unleashed at his will, he proclaims his power as a message and a warning."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000344011148-e1567676803129.jpg><h2>MAURO ICARDI</h2><p>You can bet <a href=#>his super-agent missus Wanda Nara</a> loves this tat.</p><p>Like Stokes, the Argie forward has his entire torso covered in lions - Icardi opted to have them on the front of his chest, mind.</p><p>And there's a sweet dedication in there too. Included in the design are the names of their children, Francesca and Isabella thrown in for good measure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000321402389-e1567676879566.jpg><p>I just was floating through Venice and I said ‘f*** it, I’m gonna get a tiger.’ A tiger has been jumping out at me sometimes…. I think the tiger is a courageous animal."</p><span class=quote-credit>Conor McGregor</span><h2>CONOR MCGREGOR</h2><p>UFC fighter McGregor got his lion tattoo inked on his stomach in a whim, and who would argue with him.</p><p>“I just was floating through Venice and I said ‘f*** it, I’m gonna get a tiger.’</p><p>"A tiger has been jumping out at me sometimes….
