Jenni later married her daughter’s father:&nbsp;<strong>José Trinidad Marín.</strong>&nbsp;Janney is better known by the name <strong>Chiquis</strong>, 36. Jenni’s eldest has followed in her mother’s footsteps and pursued a singing career of her own. She has three albums to her name, with her most recent being 2020’s&nbsp;Playlist. Chiquis has also had a career in reality TV, starring in a number of shows, focused on her life. The most recent was 2018’s&nbsp;The Riveras,&nbsp;which she also produced.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In 1997, it was revealed that Chiquis’ father had sexually molested her aunt&nbsp;<strong>Rosie Rivera&nbsp;</strong>and her sister&nbsp;<strong>Jacqie. </strong>José was sentenced to 31 years in prison in 2007 for sexual assault. Chiquis wrote that she forgave her father in her 2015 memoir, but hasn’t spoken to him since her mother’s death, since he didn’t offer condolences, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Billboard</a>.</p><h2><strong>Jacqie Campos</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jenni-Rivera-Family-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jenni gave birth to her second child with José in 1989. <strong>Jacquelin</strong>, 32, goes by&nbsp;<strong>Jacqie, </strong>and married her husband&nbsp;<strong>Michael Campos</strong> in 2012.

Michael originally had his father’s last name, but it appears that he now goes by his mom’s, via his<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Instagram</a>. While he may not be a musician like his mom or sisters, he is an artist in the truest sense of the word: he’s a painter! He’s been taking part in NBC and the NFL’s<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> CANVS competition,</a> which is set to “paint a path to Super Bowl LVI.” He’s shown off plenty of his awesome signs and murals, including the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>one he did for CANVS</a> on his Instagram.
