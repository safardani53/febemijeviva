and Gallacher appeared for sentence after pleading pleaded guilty last month to attempting to murder Mr McDermott.</p><p>Govan also admitted two charges of culpably and recklessly discharging a firearm in connection with Michelle being struck and Henry being killed.</p><p>Judge Lord Colbeck told them: “In the circumstances narrated to the court, the offence to which you both pled guilty is an extremely serious one involving the use of weapons against not only the victim of the attempted murder but also impacting upon an unsuspecting member of the public.”</p><p>He jailed Govan for eight years and Gallacher for six years and three months.</p><p>Both were made subject to a three year extension sentence, to be served in the community, and during which they can be recalled to prison if

was aiming more to where I was with Henry.</p><p>“Then I heard another bang, similar to the one seconds before hand.</p><p>“I also saw an orange spark coming from either the end or the middle of what I had thought was a pool cue.”</p><p>The hoods struck after McDermott arrived home with his parents in Dullatur, Cumbernauld, on January 23, 2020.</p><p>As the family got their car they noticed a Ford Focus nearby which they had spotted in the street in the weeks leading up to the shooting and thought “suspicious”.</p><p>Govan, Gallacher and a third man then jumped out the motor and were clocked on CCTV going after McDermott, with one heard yelling: “Get him.”</p><p>Their target sprinted down a lane while his dad - clutching a hockey stick - also went to try to help his son.</p><p>McDermott was initially struck on the shoulder with the machete.</p><p>He was then shot in the back before he could reach the end of a path.</p><p>Prosecutor John McElroy KC said “As he ran towards a lane, he heard a male - believed to be Gallacher - shouting: ‘Reece, don’t’.</p><p>“There was then a second gunshot.” McDermott was hit and was forced to stop. Michelle and Henry had been nearby when the second blast was fired, the court heard.</p><p>Michelle later received treatment on her injured hand but Henry died from “catastrophic organ damage”.</p><p>The attackers escaped in the Ford Focus while McDermott was rushed to hospital with lower back wounds.</p><p>Govan’s lawyer Brian McConnachie KC said his client had a fall out with Mr McDermott, in the course of which threats had been made against his grandmother, who had brought Govan up.</p><p>Tony Graham KC, for Gallacher, said his client had “taken drink” and was not the “planner or instigator” of the incident.”</p><p>Gallacher was previously jailed for ten years in 2015 for killing young dad Stephen McGinlay in St George’s Cross, Glasgow in 2014.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Holly Daniel, 24, had been accused of the reset of cars and drugs charges along with Govan but prosecutors accepted her not guilty pleas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/2020-four-men-silver-ford-556917440.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/2020-pix-alan-macgregor-ewing-556933174.jpg><p><strong>We pay for your stories and videos!
