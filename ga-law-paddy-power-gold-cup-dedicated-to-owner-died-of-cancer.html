We were very lucky to have a Festival winner at an early stage but these big days are what it’s all about.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have been on a great run of it and having plenty of winners but obviously every trainer wants to have big Saturday winners and this is a race with a rich history.</p><p>“He is owned by a great group of people and the partnership was set up for a chap called ‘Footie’ - Nick Foot who died sadly died of cancer.</p><p>“There was originally a group of six of them who always came racing to Cheltenham together and they set up this partnership with the idea of coming here and hopefully winning a big race at Cheltenham in his memory.</p><p>“Here it is and it’s all credit to this wonderful team of five guys. It all came together beautifully and no doubt they’ll raise a glass to Nick tonight.”</p><p>On this evidence, this won’t be the last big victory Ga Law’s owners can toast.</p><p>The horse missed the entire 21-22 season with a minor tendon injury, but ran a hugely encouraging race after a 603-day break in last month’s Old Roan at Aintree.</p><p>He will shoot up the weights after this success and Snowden could even be dreaming of a crack at something like the King George on Boxing Day.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Lambourn-based Snowden added: “He’s certainly not the finished article, by any means.&nbsp;</p><p>“He’s only a young horse and he made a few jumping errors early on, so hopefully there’s a few things to brush up on and who knows how good he can be.</p><p>“He stayed really well and they obviously went pretty hard early on. It took him a while to get into a good jumping rhythm but in fairness it’s only his second run out of novice company.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was his first big-field handicap and with that comes the unexposed nature of the horse, but inexperience counts as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“He was probably a little further back than we ideally wanted, but once he found his feet he galloped and stayed and stamina has won at the end of the day – so he definitely wants every yard of that trip.</p><p>“Maybe we can start to dream of big races - but will enjoy today and then make a plan.”</p><p>Tipperary trainer Morris was down but not out after the race, and he will now begin plotting French Dynamite’s route back to Cheltenham in March.</p><p>He said: “He just missed out the last a bit and lost his momentum as he just caught the top of it but I’m not making excuses. He was second that is it.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is only a pup and he is a huge horse at 17 hands. He will get me out of bed in the morning through the winter.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Here around Cheltenham they have never won until they are past the post and I’m well used to that now. Hopefully he can go one better on his next visit.”</p><p>He might have had a brush with the Law, but Morris, and his Irish counterparts, will be back.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
