However, she also jokingly warned Jowsey, who is eight years older than Rylee, “Don’t kiss my sister.”</p><p>DWTS judge <a href=#><strong>Derek Hough</strong></a>, meanwhile, seemed to <a href=#>give the twosome his blessing</a> during an October 2023 episode of the show. “Y’all are so cute together,” he said after they performed a foxtrot. “I love the chemistry.”</p><p>Scroll through to see Jowsey and Rylee’s sweetest quotes about their bond:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Harry-Jowsey-and-Rylee-Arnolds-Quotes-About-Their-Bond-02.jpg><h3>Singing Each Other’s Praises</h3><p>“[Rylee’s] ’s never in a bad mood and she’s always bubbly and brings me up when I’m feeling a little bit flat, or in my head about things, and knows when to sit me down and talk me out of whatever hump I’m in,” Jowsey exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2023. “I feel like everyone needs that in a person in their life. She’s<a href=#> everything you could ever dream of</a>.”</p><p>Rylee echoed her partner’s sentiments, telling Us that although she “honestly wasn’t sure about what to expect” from Jowsey, she was pleasantly surprised during their first meeting.</p><p>“He walks in the door [and] he’s the sweetest person you’ll ever meet,” she said. “So sweet, so fun to be around.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Harry-Jowsey-and-Rylee-Arnolds-Quotes-About-Their-Bond-01.jpg><h3>‘Focused on Rylee’</h3><p>Jowsey exclusively told Us in October 2023 that it’s “to be decided” whether he’s single. “Honestly, I’m just focused on Rylee right now,” he said.</p><h3>Cool and Coy</h3><p>With dating speculation continuing to swirl, Jowsey told Entertainment Tonight in October that he <a href=#>wanted to “keep the mystery”</a> in his partnership with Rylee.</p><p>“We just enjoy hanging out and we love each other, so it’s been great,” he said.</p><p>Rylee agreed, telling the outlet: “We just love everybody that’s supporting us and we’re having so much fun together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Harry-Jowsey-and-Rylee-Arnolds-Quotes-About-Their-Bond-03.jpg><h3>Defending His Partner</h3><p>“I think it’s unfair on Rylee to put, like, pressure on this when it’s her first [DWTS] season,” Jowsey told Page Six of the romance rumors in October 2023. “And, you know, whatever’s <a href=#>going on behind the scenes</a> is gonna go on behind the scenes.”</p><p>The reality star also addressed a TikTok video that went viral earlier that month which showed him holding hands with Rylee as they made their way through a crowd inside Los Angeles’ Hollywood Palladium.</p><p>“That video does look pretty wild but we got pushed into a corner. We were trying to get out of this concert,” Jowsey explained. “We’re just focusing on the dance and just enjoying being together and if something happens, something happens.”</p><p>When asked whether the outing in question was a date or a group outing, Jowsey and Rylee looked at each other and laughed. “Yes, just a group hang,” Rylee said while giggling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Harry-Jowsey-and-Rylee-Arnolds-Quotes-About-Their-Bond-04.jpg><h3>Harry Starts His Own Rumor</h3><p>While speaking with Extra after an October 2023 episode of DWTS, Jowsey had a playful response when asked if the duo had any news to share. “<a href=#>She’s pregnant</a>,” he quipped, touching Rylee’s stomach. “Harry!” Rylee exclaimed in response, laughing and covering her face with her hands.</p><p>“I’m joking,” Jowsey emphasized before noting that he “wouldn’t want to be [partnered] with anyone else.”</p><h3>‘You’ve Got a Friend In Me’</h3><p>During <a href=#>DWTS’ Disney100 Night</a> in October 2023, the duo danced to “You’ve Got a Friend In Me” from Toy Story. As part of the routine, Arnold kissed Jowsey on the cheek at the end of the dance.</p><p>“He has truly become my best friend and our chemistry together really just makes us come out each week and get better,” Arnold told cameras ahead of the performance.</p><p>Jowsey agreed, saying: “No matter what happens this week, it’s comforting knowing I have a friend in Rylee.”</p><p>After Jowsey and Rylee took the stage, cohost <a href=#><strong>Julianne Hough</strong></a> addressed them as “lovebirds” and asked Jowsey what he liked about his partner.</p><p>“She’s just so sweet and understanding and patient with me,” he gushed. “She’s just beautiful and amazing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Harry-Jowsey-and-Dancing-With-the-Stars-Partner-Rylee-Arnold-s-Quotes-About-Their-Bond-534.jpg><h3><strong>Defending Rylee</strong></h3><p>Jowsey <a href=#>came to Rylee’s defense</a> in October 2023 after online critics slammed the pair’s contemporary dance to <strong>Andy Grammer</strong>’s “Keep Your Head Up.”</p><p>“I just want to say: Today has been extremely difficult. Poor Rylee is really upset. I’m really upset,” Jowsey said via his Instagram Story. “I think we’re both equally devastated and upset about last night, ’cause it wasn’t our night, wasn’t our best dance.”</p><p>Still, the reality star pointed out: “If you don’t have anything nice to say, please don’t say it. This is Rylee’s first season, I’ve never danced before. We’re learning, we’re figuring it out,” he explained. “That’s the point of this show — to have someone who’s never danced before, put ‘em on the world stage and tell them to try and figure it out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jowsey ended his message to trolls by gushing over his partner.</p><p>“I love spending time with Rylee. She’s an incredible person, she’s an incredible woman, and it’s been such a joy to be with her,” he said. “Anyway, I’m dragging this on, but if you see a nasty comment, just tell them to keep it to themselves. It’s just not very nice to read. It was just really difficult for both of us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuwrKNitaK%2B0bJko6enqLK6ecCnm2aqqaGypnnAq6WopJSoerLBzq2crGWRl7y2wIytn56homKvsLrDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-scelfo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Scelfo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-woodley.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Woodley</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
