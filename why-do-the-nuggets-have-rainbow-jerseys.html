If you’ve been a Nuggets fan for a while, their jerseys might not come as a surprise to you, but as soon as they started playing in the “bubble,” people began searching for the meaning behind the rainbows. Here’s what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do the Nuggets have rainbow jerseys?</h2><p>Currently, one of the jerseys the Nuggets are sporting are black with white mountain peaks and rainbow stripes. It’s a very cool look. Interestingly enough, these jerseys — their City Edition jerseys — aren’t the first Nuggets jerseys to include rainbow stripes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Nuggets’ first rainbow jerseys were worn by the team from the 1981 - 1982 season through the 1992 - 1993 season. The jersey itself was white, featuring the Denver skyline set against the Rocky Mountains and a rainbow-colored background. It was designed by fans in advance of the 1981 season and was known as the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rainbow Skyline</u></a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At the time, the rainbow design was chosen because it “represented the vibrancy and growth of Denver that occurred in the 1980s. While the Rainbow Skyline jerseys stuck around for several seasons, the Nuggets eventually switched to a new design for the 1993 - 1994 season and beyond. Until 2018, that is.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Things you could have told me five months ago that I wouldn’t believe:</p><p>-Michael Porter Jr. starts the Nuggets first playoff game<br>-Denver is the home team, but the game is being played at Disney World<br>-Nuggets wear their rainbow skyline jerseys for game 1</p><p>It’s all happening.</p>— Brandon Ewing (@B_Skip1717) <a href=#>August 17, 2020</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That’s when the Nuggets brought the Rainbow Skyline back for their City Edition jerseys. Then, for the 2019 - 2020 season, they made a slight change and switched from white jerseys to black jerseys. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nuggets’ Merch Shop</u></a>, the design is inspired by the region’s natural hues. The Nuggets have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>also said</u></a> that the uniform is “a celebration of the people and neighborhoods that make Mile High Basketball and Denver unique.”</p><p>The rainbow jerseys aren’t the only way the Nuggets honor their unique Denver fans and neighborhoods. They have also held a slate of diversity and inclusion nights over the years, including Pride Nights, a Black History celebration, a Hispanic Heritage Night, and a celebration of the Lunar New Year.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The Denver Nuggets are proud to celebrate and recognize our diverse fanbase,” said Kroenke Sports & Entertainment SVP and CMO Declan J. Bolger. “We support equality and strive to reflect the community and region that we serve.”</p><p>Many Nuggets fans see the City Edition jerseys as good omens for the team’s playoff chances. While the team wore the original Rainbow Skyline jerseys in the ‘80s and ‘90s, they made the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons. Coincidence? Maybe! But we’re glad to see the rainbow jerseys make another appearance in this year’s playoffs, too. Regardless of how you feel about the Nuggets, you have to admit that their jerseys look sharp!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZK2glWK7trPGnqusZZiWw6Z50Zqgp5qfrHqrsdGsnLKr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beauty-fan-savers-haul-fake-eyelashes-skincare-cheap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./luann-de-lesseps-son.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Luann de Lesseps Son?
