She revealed that her own weight loss was a major eye opener about the positive effect fitness can have on people’s lives, and now she wants to help people “regain their lives” through fitness. Kody is supportive of Janelle’s dream, but admitted he’s concerned about the financial impact it could have on their family.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Meanwhile, Kody and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Meri</a></strong> decided to consult a fertility specialist about their problems getting pregnant. As the first wife, Meri struggled while watching her fellow sister wives have children before her. She revealed that after they had their first daughter, <strong>Mariah</strong>, she suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I didn’t understand why after another 12 years of trying,” Meri said through tears. “And then it was taken away from us and I didn’t understand that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After one fertility specialist recommended IVF, Meri and Kody decided to get a second opinion. The second specialist recommended using donor eggs, but the couple didn’t think that would be an option for them either.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In honor of Valentine’s Day, Kody attended a special dance for daughters and fathers at the kids’ elementary school. The girls were extremely excited and dressed up for the occasion, and Meri even came over to <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Robyn</a></strong>‘s house to help get the girls ready for the dance. Meri admitted she feels separated from the young children because of their distant homes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Later, in a confession, Robyn warmly told Meri, “I want my kids to have the exposure of you as a mother.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The women then decided to decorate Kody’s car as a Valentine’s Day surprise. Robyn planned to ask Kody to borrow his car because she had a flat tire, and Kody almost ruined the surprise by trying to fix her tire instead of lending her the car! Thankfully, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christine</a></strong> helped distract Kody and the plan worked perfectly. Robyn told Kody she wrecked the car and needed him to come look at it, which is when the family surprised Kody with balloons and pink writing all over his car. Kody presented each of the wives with a bouquet of flowers to celebrate Valentine’s Day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The family met with the loan officer and were shocked to learn that one of the properties they were looking at had been sold and the price was going to be double what they thought. The family decided that the best plan was to move on and keep looking for homes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Do you think the Browns are making the right decision, <strong>HollywoodLifers?</strong></p><h3>— Jenny Pickard</h3><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>More Sister Wives News:</strong></p><li>‘Sister Wives’ Won’t Face Bigamy Charges</li><li>‘Sister Wives:’ Robyn, Thanks For Being Honest That You’d Strangle Kody Brown For Taking A Fifth Wife</li><li>Kody Brown: You Blew Off Wife #3 Christine’s Marriage Concerns</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWliZH13e49tZqyho6mys3nWoq2eq12nsqStz2aknqqZYrqqv8KaqauhkZyybrfOnbBmmqKkxK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jason-bravura-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jason Bravura Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maude-apatow-judd-apatow-racism-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maude Apatow and Judd Apatows Deleted Tweets Get Mixed with Racism</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
