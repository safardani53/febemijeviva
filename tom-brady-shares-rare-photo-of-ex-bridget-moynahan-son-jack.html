We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way. We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve.”</p><p>Bündchen, for her part, said that she and her ex are committed to coparenting, adding: “I feel blessed for the time we had together and only wish the best for Tom always.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51ir7Otw7JkrKCRp7K0edGaqZ5loJ28tbuMqJ1mnahir7O1w6CcrWWdpMavrceapWarn6N6q63CpGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ozzy-osbourne-first-wife-thelma-mayfair-riley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ozzy Osbourne's First Wife Thelma Mayfair Riley?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stars-heels-winter-pics-3494407.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pics Of Hailey Baldwin &amp;amp; More Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
