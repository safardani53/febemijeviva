I want to be in love again,” the 70-year-old said in her introduction video. After weeks of getting to know Gerry, Theresa captured his heart.

Theresa admitted that the wedding dress she chose was “not exactly what” she thought she’d pick.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Theresa hails from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, and she made a memorable first impression with Gerry, 72, during the series premiere. Theresa came on<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;The Golden Bachelor</a> looking for “the real deal.” She ultimately became Gerry’s perfect match. Here’s what you need to know about Theresa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/theresa-nist-finale-embed.jpg><h2>Theresa Won ‘The Golden Bachelor’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Theresa first caught Gerry’s eye during The Golden Bachelor premiere. When Theresa walked out of the limo and up to Gerry, she surprised him by showing off her “birthday suit,” which consisted of a tan slip under a black shawl. Later, Theresa and Gerry had some one-on-one time. She read Gerry a letter that her daughter had written to her before she came on the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Gerry surprised Theresa with a cupcake in honor of her 70th birthday. He took a bite out of the cupcake, and they shared a passionate kiss. “It’s been forever since I kissed a guy, and it felt incredible,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Theresa and Gerry’s relationship continued to develop throughout the season. After their Fantasy Suite date, Theresa and Gerry had an honest discussion about their night together. “Everything you said was a revelation, and it was pretty awesome,” Gerry said to Theresa.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Theresa gushed that it “felt so great waking up next to Gerry and that could be the first time that I woke up next to my husband.” While relaxing in bed, Theresa told Gerry, “In case I haven’t said it, I’m crazy about you. I love you.” Gerry told Theresa that he loved her the night before.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>During The Golden Bachelor finale, Gerry chose to be with Theresa over <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Leslie Fhima</strong></a>. Gerry proposed to Theresa in Costa Rica. Host <strong>Jesse Palmer</strong> told the couple that the show would be sending them on a trip to Italy next year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“We can use that as our honeymoon trip because we are going to get married,” Gerry said. “We’re going to do it as quickly as we can because, at our age, we don’t have a lot of time to waste. As quickly as we can put together a wedding plan, we’re getting married.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Gerry and Theresa will tie the knot in a live TV ceremony on January 4, 2024. Fellow Golden Bachelor contestant <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Susan Noles</strong></a> will officiate the ceremony. Following their wedding, Gerry and Theresa are going to settle down in their forever home.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“We’re going to buy a house,” Gerry told <strong>Hollywood Life</strong>. “And of course, we’re working backwards from that. When do I want to sell my house? When does Theresa want to sell? What locations do we want to look at? I’m all of a sudden really thinking that New Jersey is a great place. It’s a two-hour plane ride from Indianapolis. It’s a great choice. So we have places to look.”</p><h2>Theresa Works in Finance</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Theresa “taught herself all about the stock market,” according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC bio</a>.

Like Gerry, Theresa lost her first great love. Bill passed away in 2014. Theresa’s daughter, <strong>Jen</strong>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>penned a heartfelt tribute</a> to her father on the 8th anniversary of his death in November 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>On the 9th anniversary of Bill’s death, Theresa shared a touching message about her late husband. “Billy and I met when I was 14 and he was 16,” she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “We got married at 18 and 20. He was stationed in Berlin during the Vietnam war. I took my first plane ride and we lived there for almost a year. Living in Berlin, I realize now and at the time, was a once in the lifetime experience.”</p><h2>Theresa Has Two Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Theresa is a mother to a son named <strong>Tommy</strong> and a daughter named <strong>Jen</strong>. According to their Instagram pages, Tommy and Jen both have three sons, making Theresa a grandmother to six grandsons.</p><h2>Theresa Loves to Garden</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Theresa has shared photos on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> of the beautiful flowers she’s picked from her garden.
