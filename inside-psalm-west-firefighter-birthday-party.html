U.S. Sun revealed a<a href=#> slew of new trademarks were filed</a> for the toddler, teasing the possibilities of Psalm toys and clothing.</p><p>Kim's first of 12 trademarks covers "non-medicated skin care preparations; skin moisturizers; skin lotions; skin creams; skin cleansers" and other various cosmetics.</p><p>The second filing includes: "Probiotic supplements; nutritional supplements; vitamins; baby diapers; baby cloth diapers; anti-inflammatory ointments; baby food; infant formula."</p><p>Psalm's third trademark contains: "Strollers; stroller covers; children's car seats; fitted covers for children's car seats."</p><p>The fourth promises "clocks; jewelry; watches; keychains" while the fifth dabbles in "calendars; books; magazines and periodicals in the fields of music; entertainment" and more.</p><p>The sixth trademark states Psalm's business future could include "baby carriers worn on the body; all-purpose carrying bags; backpacks; handbags; tote bags; purses; wallets; bags for carrying babies' accessories; diaper bags" and more.</p><p>Psalm's seventh trademark branches out into "furniture; cribs; baby bouncers; baby changing mats; baby walkers; mattresses; cushions; nursing pillows; foot stools; mirrors" and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

namely, household linens, bath linens, bed linens, kitchen linens, and table linens; drapery; afghans; throws; comforters; bed blankets; baby bedding, namely, swaddling blankets, crib bumpers" and more.</p><p>However, Kim's ninth trademark for her son includes various clothing items such as "coats; dresses; footwear; headwear; jackets; jumpers; loungewear; rompers; scarves; shirts" and more.</p><p>The tenth includes "toy figures; doll accessories; puzzles; party games; toy jewelry; puppets; hand-held units for playing electronic games; children's educational toys for developing fine motor and cognitive skills" and more.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Psalm's eleventh and twelfth filings promise "advertising services, namely, promoting the brands, goods, and services of others; endorsement services" and "entertainment in the nature of providing information by means of a global computer network in the fields of entertainment and pop culture; entertainment services, namely, personal appearances by a celebrity."</p><p>Psalm's last trademarks were all filed in 2019, so it looks like the young toddler was due for a fresh update of permit applications.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
