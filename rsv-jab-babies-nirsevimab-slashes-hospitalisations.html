one of the three UK universities spearheading the study - RSV is a leading <a href=#>cause of infant hospitalisation</a>, causing between 20 and 30 deaths per year in the UK.</p><p>The virus is responsible for hospitalising around 33,000 children under five years old annually, a <a aria-label="press release (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> for the study added.</p><p>Scientists from University Hospital Southampton, the University of Southampton and St George’s University Hospital say an antibody treatment called nirsevimab could slash RSV-related hospitalisations by 83 per cent.</p><p>The treatment was approved in the UK last year, but experts said at the time that more research was needed before it could be available on the NHS.</p><p>The jab is being rolled out in the US and <a href=#>Spain</a> this winter and the treatment is being considered in the UK for a national RSV immunisation programme.</p><p>The study -
