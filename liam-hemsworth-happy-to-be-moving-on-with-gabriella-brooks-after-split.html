The “Slide Away” singer announced their separation in August, a day after she was spotted snuggling with <a href=#><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></a>’s ex <a href=#><strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong></a>. The pair’s romance quickly heated up before <a href=#>flaming out a month later</a>. Cyrus is <a href=#>now dating another Australian</a>, singer <a href=#><strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a>.</p><p>Hemsworth <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Cyrus just 11 days after she confirmed their breakup. “He’s not upset with Miley, but is happy to be moving on,” the source told Us.</p><p>The Grammy nominee, 27, <a href=#>poked fun at her short-lived marriage</a> on Instagram earlier this week, in a response to a proposal from artist <strong>Matty Mo.</strong></p><p>After the artist changed his Instagram bio to read, “Getting married to @mileycyrus in 2020,” and shared a screenshot of the declaration on Thursday, December 19, Cyrus commented, “It probably won’t last long. But always down to try, You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”</p><p>She also <a href=#>threw shade at Liam</a> — who she’d dated on and off for 10 years before they wed in December 2018 — in an Instagram Live video with Simpson in October.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There are good people out there that just happen to have d–ks. I’ve only ever met one, and he’s on this live,” the Disney alum told the “Golden Thing” singer.</p><p>“You don’t have to be gay, there are good people with d–ks out there … you’ve just got to find them. You’ve got to find a d–k that’s not a d–k, you know,” Cyrus, who often refers to herself as queer, explained to Simpson. “I always thought I had to be gay, because I thought all guys were evil, but it’s not true.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZGieqmxzKyuqKqknXqprc%2BpsGasn2KvpnnMqK2ippdivK951qKroWWXlq%2BztcSlo5plkqe8sLfSZpifrJWnerS8y6KraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-island-ron-hall-career-move-imposter-syndrome.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love Island's Ron Hall reveals surprise career move as he opens up about 'imposter syndrome'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lala-kent-vs-kristen-doute-brawl-goes-down-at-sur.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lala Kent vs. Kristen Doute BRAWL Goes Down at SUR!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
