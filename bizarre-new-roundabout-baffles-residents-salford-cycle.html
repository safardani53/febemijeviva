creating a hazard for pedestrians who have to cross it.</p><p>Charlene Kelly, 34, said: “It could get dangerous, especially for kids going to the nearby school.</p><p>“Some e-bikes come flying down the path so there could easily be an accident.</p><p>“The roundabout is such an odd design.”</p><p>Adele Burns, 32, said, “I don’t understand the whole process behind it.</p><p>“I’ve lived her for three years and the roadworks have been going on for ages.</p><p>“Some times the noise would start early morning or go on until late at night and cause a lot of inconvenience.</p><p>“The existing path was already used by cyclists and pedestrians, so I don’t really see why it was necessary to spend extra money on the roundabout.”</p><p>Michelle Carrasco who walks to work along the route of the cycle path, said: “I don’t see how the roundabout helps.</p><p>“It’s a bit confusing for pedestrians because it’s not clear how you’re supposed to cross it."</p><p>“If it becomes a hassle I’ll have to start going a different way to work," the 25-year-old added.</p><p>An unnamed man blasted: “It’s a waste of time.</p><p>“It took a long time to build and I can’t really see the point of it.</p><p>“God knows how much it cost.”</p><p>Soph Hinxman-Allegri, 19, said: “It’s odd to say the least.</p><p>“What is the purpose of it?</p><p>“It sticks out like a sore thumb.</p><p>“It seems a bit dangerous for pedestrians because it’s not clear how they’re supposed to cross it.</p><p>“Most will just go across the middle.”</p><p>Even cyclists aren’t convinced of the roundabout’s value.</p><p>Hamish Gray, who runs the campaigning group Walk Ride Central Salford, tweeted that pedestrian experience was “hugely compromised” and they would have to “cross into a ring of fire” to exit it.</p><p>"Similarly, the cycle desire line is also the opposite to what's designed. You want to either cut across the opposite lane or go across the middle.</p><p>"These both leave peds and cycles in conflict."</p><p>Salford Council's lead member for planning and sustainable development, Coun Mike McCusker claimed that the roundabout is “possibly the first of its kind” in England.</p><p>He admitted it had “created debate”, but there had also been “positive feedback".</p><p>“The roundabout allows pedestrians to cross the junction safely in two short moves so they only have to be aware of one lane of cycle traffic at a time,” he said.</p><p>“It provides a quicker crossing for them and is safer than trying to cross a wider junction with traffic from both directions.</p><p>“It has been designed to accommodate people on foot or in wheelchairs or pushing buggies.</p><p>"Cyclists circulate round it like a ‘normal’ road roundabout so they, too, can get round this junction safely without putting pedestrians in danger.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>It was built as part of an upgraded cycle lane and wider road improvement scheme in Salford - with the aim to encourage more cycling.</p><p>The council say it was developed after extensive consultation with the public, cyclists and a number of other groups.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mad-cycle-roundabout-salfod-residents-782447103.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mad-cycle-roundabout-salfod-residents-782446963.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzfJZxa3FvZmSvqsbAq6meZZ6axG6%2Bzq6lnZmSpMK1ecGanZ%2Bklah6s7HSopuepqSoerSty5%2Bmq5xdmMakuMRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./courtney-hicks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Courtney Hicks</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-good-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>About The Good Wife on Paramount Plus</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
