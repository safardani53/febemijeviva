The movie follows Ben, a kid who recently lost his mom and decides to enter a competition to win a fully tricked-out home with a personal assistant (similar to the Siris and Alexas of today). His family wins and moves in, at first enjoying the high-tech features — floors that sense dirt or spills and sucks them up immediately, fresh cupcakes that pop out of the counters for an after-school snack, a <i>Clueless</i>-like algorithm that determines what clothes to wear that day — but the personal assistant, PAT, played by Katey Sagal, soon becomes a bit too overbearing, and it begins to wreck havoc on their lives.

Any preteen girl felt that acutely upon seeing Katherine Heigl's frosted pink lipstick and icy lavender eyeshadow in this movie. Awkward younger sister Hayley wishes upon a star to get to walk in the platform sandals of her popular older sister Alexia — and then the two of them try to take each other down from the other's bodies, before finally coming to an understanding about how tough it truly is to be the other. Though it's <i>technically</i> the last Disney Channel Premiere movie before DCOMs took off, I count it because it's got all the hallmarks of a truly great DCOM (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>including a soon-to-be giant star</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">—Alex Apatoff</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-z-o-m-b-i-e-s-2018></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Z-O-M-B-I-E-S, 2018</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>John Medland/Disney Channel/Everett</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Underneath the fun makeup, cool costumes and extremely catchy songs, <i>Z-O-M-B-I-E-S </i>is a take on a story we're all familiar with: a boy and a girl who can't be together because of where they come from. The movie also shares ever-important message of acceptance and teaches viewers to celebrate what makes everyone unique. Like many of our favorites, <i>Z-O-M-B-I-E-S </i>was just the beginning as there have since been two follow-up films.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">—Alexandra Schonfeld</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-princess-protection-program-2009></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Princess Protection Program, 2009</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>FRANCISCO ROMAN/DISNEY CHANNEL</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just when you thought no movie could do modern-day princess like Anne Hathaway did in <i>The Princess Diaries</i>, <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Demi Lovato</a> and <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Selena Gomez</a> gave us <i>Princess Protection Program</i>. When this movie premiered, I was 10 years old and still debating whether I resonated more with the angsty Carter Mason (Gomez) or Princess Rosalinda (Lovato) — turns out I ended up being a mix both, ha! Nonetheless, this movie taught me the importance of being open and accepting of others — and that two people from very different worlds could still come together to form a lasting friendship. Also, who doesn't love a final homecoming dance scene where the mean girl meets her fate, boy finally tells girl how he feels and an iconic collaborative single like "One in the Same"?

It had an otherworldly quality, from the names of the characters (Galleria, Chanel, Aquanette and Dorinda) to the fact that they were going on Fifth Avenue shopping sprees to acquire even more cheetah-print clothing to mix and match. Starring Raven-Symoné, Adrienne Bailon, Sabrina Bryan and Kiely Williams, the movie was also executive produced by Whitney Huston. With so many real-life musicians on board, it makes sense that the message for The Cheetah Girls' young audience was inspired by the power of friendship and the importance of living your dreams. And, importantly, not to give in to the demands of a slimy music exec. As a tween who frequently performed songs, dances and plays with her friends, all I could hope was to someday emulate these Cheetah Sisters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">—Amanda Taylor</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zenon-girl-of-the-21st-century-1999></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, 1999</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Disney</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zetus lapetus, Nebula! As a true child of the '90s, this DCOM was a fun, colorful and stylized prediction of the future, set in 2049 (when Chelsea Clinton is president). Zenon Kar (Kirsten Storms) is a spunky 13-year-old girl with the coolest neon fashions, who lives on a space station with her parents and her best friend Nebula (Raven-Symoné), and does cool stuff like upcycling sketchy discs into funky accessories and literally putting on an astronaut suit and floating out in space. After getting into too much trouble, she gets sent to live with her aunt on Earth, where she crushes on a cute boy (Gregory Smith), meets her pop idol, Microbe's Proto Zoa (Phillip Rhys) and foils a criminal plot to crash the space station. If you're a '90s kid, you probably still want to own Zenon's wardrobe and you definitely still remember all the words to "Supernova Girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">—Glenn Garner</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKOx0q1knaGjo7K6ecKhmKemlaF6sL7IoKCnmZxiurDCyJ6qaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pretty-little-liars-finale-recap-ezra-gets-shot-season-4-episode-24.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ezra Gets Shot, Alison Tells The Truth Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1jcomv7v1ixqgpevewh6wbpaxpum4lhc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch SkyMed Season 1 Episode 8: Frozen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
