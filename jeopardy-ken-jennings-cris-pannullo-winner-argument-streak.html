Tell us about your cute pet."</p><p>"Well about 10 years ago my girlfriend Heather spotted a rabbit hopping in our front yard," Cris began.</p><p>Ever since, he revealed: "We have lived at the mercy of a bunny named Lentils."</p><p>"Lentils is cute," Ken added: "Does Lentils eat lentils?"</p><p>Cris sharply snapped back: "No you cannot feed a rabbit lentils."</p><p>The crowd nervously laughed as Ken physically jumped back and put up his hands.</p><p>"Oh, please, do not feed rabbits lentils, Cris is warning you off!"</p><p>"Hay," Cris then went as far as corrected on what rabbits eat. "A lot of timothy hay."</p><p>A former competitor&nbsp;<a href=#>exclusively</a>&nbsp;also did say that before Cris takes the stage, he is not&nbsp;<a href=#>looking to mingle.</a></p><p>"He was very nice, very polite but he did sit separately from everyone else. He was quiet and it was hard to get a read on him."</p><h2>JEOPARDY! ACE</h2><p>Fans, however, are loving Cris as his games see him win by huge amounts and with (otherwise) huge bets.</p><p>Going into Final Jeopardy, he made up for it with $29,600, Elizabeth had $8,600 and Fernando $5,000.</p><p>Under the category "20th Century Leaders" it read: "In a Sept. 3, 1939, speech, he said, 'Everything that I have worked for…has crashed into ruins'."</p><p>Everyone got the clue correct with "Who is Neville Chamberlain" - Cris added $8,221 to win with $37,821.</p><p>He has a staggering nine-day total of $313,323, and fans cannot believe his power playing.</p><p>With a 94% accuracy on clues and a stunning 20 correct out of 23 on the special Daily Doubles total, often going right for the bottom of the board - fans have called him a "machine."</p><p>It's the same way "Jeopardy! James" Holzhauer, a poker player himself, often widened his lead and won his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">32 games in 2019</a>, and millions of fans for his lightning-fast abilities.</p><p>One fan wrote tonight on YouTube: "I love greatness [and] this guy Cris is trying to put himself in elite company."</p><p>Another exclaimed: "Another dominant performance by Cris, and for a moment, it looked like he was completely eviscerating the competition."</p><p>A third on YouTube simply wrote: "Wow."</p><p>Cris is now the winningest contestant since last season's <a href=#>Mattea Roach</a> and is in the top 12 winningest contestants ever - already.</p><h2>SEASON 39</h2><p><a href=#>Jeopardy!'s</a>&nbsp;brand new season&nbsp;premiered last month and alum&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>&nbsp;is hosting until January.</p><p>As Season 38 wrapped and before the now-airing Season 39, he and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;- now handling&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;- were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><p>Ken and Mayim began regularly filling in for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>legendary Alex</a>&nbsp;in 2021 after his tragic 2020 passing at age 80 and a whirlwind of Season 37 celebrity guest hosts.</p><p>They included&nbsp;<a href=#>Savannah Guthrie</a>, fan-favorite&nbsp;<a href=#>LeVar Burton</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Dr. Oz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>, and many more who each scored a week or so at it.</p><p>The search also landed on&nbsp;<a href=#>former executive producer Mike Richards</a>&nbsp;who nabbed the host gig from the inside before the shocking decision was "reversed" a week later.</p><p>Next week regular gameplay will pause for two tournaments which will air instead of regular episodes for at least four weeks.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Those would be the&nbsp;<a href=#>Second Chance Tournament</a>&nbsp;airing on Monday and the subsequent, weightier&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;- both hosted by Ken.</p><p>The cool, calculated and cash-collecting card player will go for his astounding tenth win tomorrow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/champ-cris-pannullo-gets-visibly-767582993.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/champ-cris-pannullo-gets-visibly-767583091-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/champ-cris-pannullo-gets-visibly-767583092.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZGeGeH2XaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmabop7AbrzAp6WupJykeri1zaecq2WRp7S2ucSnq2arpKeyoreO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-duggar-jim-bob-was-afraid-of-his-daughters-demonic-dolls-is-still-a-paranoid-loser.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Bob Was Afraid of His Daughter's &amp;quot;Demonic&amp;quot; Dolls, Is Still a Paranoid Loser!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hollyoaks-nadine-mulkerrin-rory-douglas-speed-birthday-reggie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Hollyoaks Nadine Mulkerrin and Rory Douglas-Speed's son's first birthday with day trip out to</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
