Now, the 23-year-old has a spot in the top 20, and has become a fan-favorite, as well. His powerful vocals and epic stage presence have helped put Uche at the front of the pack, and you can learn more about where he came from and what he did before coming onto&nbsp;American Idol here:</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. He’s a wedding singer.</strong> Before auditioning for&nbsp;Idol, Uche worked as the singer in a wedding band called Drywater Band. He performed cover songs with the group all over Texas at weddings and other events. The band, which began in Houston, was founded in 2004. There are actually four different variations of the group, so they’re able to match the taste of their individual clients as best as possible. With the group, Uche performed songs like “24K” and “Soul Man,” amongst dozens of others.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. He was in a commercial with Joe Jonas.</strong> Aside from just singing, Uche has also done some work in modeling, which made him the perfect fit for the ACUVUE 1-Day Contest in 2013. He won the contest, and was selected to star in his very own commercial for the brand alongside&nbsp;<strong>Joe Jonas</strong>. Through the contest, he received mentorship from Joe, allowing him to release his first original song and video,</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>3. He’s opened for well-known stars in concert.</strong> Uche is no stranger to performing in front of a live audience, and has even opened up for&nbsp;<strong>Demi Lovato</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>B.O.B.</strong> in the past.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>4. He was a dancer before he became a singer.</strong> Uche grew up in Minnesota and starting acting and dancing when he was 11-years-old. He perfected his dancing skills by visiting Nigeria over the summers and learning different techniques. After receiving feedback from a number of casting directors and agents, Uche began singing in his high school and church choir, but it wasn’t until he began performing as a solo artist that he really felt like he belonged in the industry.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>5. He’s already released an EP</strong>. Uche released his debut EP,&nbsp;My Generation, in 2017. Of the record, he explained, “My Generation speaks of the issues I have with my own generation. I meant it to be a musical vehicle that provides fiercely honest social commentary on my generations dulled social conscious, its fascination with living a life of “excess” and the rampart drug use that powers this ever popular YOLO spirit.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LCpLTEZpimnaKesKK6jKKbqKRdmLyvwMSsq5qmpGKAdoKYbW9pZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-tania-and-perry-still-married.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Tania and Perry From 'Pit Bulls and Parolees' Still Married?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-levert.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Levert</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
