Based on Shaela's video, she says that Ashley's husband reached out to her, and while they never met in person, they did communicate. Shaela explains that she doesn't think this "man wasn't being heard."</p><p>If it feels like this video was out of nowhere, then we are right there with her. Some of the comments say, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT," and "This like that 1 passage that’s they give you on that reading exam that’s outta context and you gotta answer questions about it but ur so confused."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ashley addressed this on her page starting the video by saying that she planned to keep the details private.
