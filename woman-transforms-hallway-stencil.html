I am really pleased with the effect and glad I did it.</p><p>“The stencil is quite large and you get a smaller piece to get a straight line on top.</p><p>“Less is actually more and it gave an aged patchy look, which I really liked. Then I gently removed and started again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600035927.jpg><p>“The only thing was that the stencil had to be washed at regular intervals.”</p><p>Natalie spent six weeks stenciling the stylish pattern onto the wall - and said she would do a little bit each day on rainy days.</p><p>However she admits that she made a lot of mistakes at the beginning as she struggled with the hallway’s bends and corners.</p><p>Despite describing it as ‘challenging’ and ‘frustrating’, Natalie said she left it until the end and then tackled the tough areas individually.</p><p>Natalie added: “Once I got the hang of it, stencilling a plain straight wall became pretty easy and towards the end it became quite quick to do.</p><p>“I was really pleased with the end result and it actually turned out better than I expected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600035893.jpg><p>“Also to add a bit of interest, I swapped the colour around going up the stairs, so the darker colour was the base colour, I really love that.</p><p>“It has made such a difference to the hallway. It has brought it up to date and seems a lot wider and brighter, I am so pleased I have done it now.”</p><p>Natalie, who shares her home DIY skills on her Instagram page (@vivifica1930), believes her job as an eyelash technician meant she had enough patience to tackle the hefty amount of stencilling.</p><p>She posted her before and after transformation pictures on a Facebook DIY group and said users have been complimenting her DIY skills - and thought it was a fancy wallpaper.</p><p>She has been overwhelmed with the response as many people have praised her for being a ‘perfectionist.</p><p>She said: “Everyone that has seen it thinks it's actually wallpaper, which is quite a compliment as it must look quite neat.</p><p>“I am still getting comments from people saying they “love the wallpaper” and saying how much patience I must have.</p><p>“One lady mentioned that my walls were a labour of love, and just like labour, the end result was so worth it. To which I responded that just like labour, I have now forgotten how painful it was.”</p><p>One user wrote: “I love that wallpaper!”</p><p>Another commented: “It’s lovely! You did all that with a stencil AMAZING. You must have some patience!”</p><p>A third shared: “Fantastic - you must have the patience of a Saint.”</p><p>Another added: “Lovely, you would think it was wallpaper! Well done!”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>In other DIY news, this <a href=#>woman turned her IKEA counter into a marble dressing table using free B&M samples.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>And this&nbsp;<a href=#>woman got her grotty oven door sparkling in minutes</a>&nbsp;without using ANY cleaning products.</p><p>Plus this&nbsp;<a href=#>cleaning fanatic instantly got rid of creases in sheets using £1 B&M spray</a>&nbsp;& shoppers are rushing to stock up.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman turns drab garden into chic space with Amazon bargains and Dunelm egg chairs – and people say it looks BIGGER</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BrampqZm5%2FcMPOppinZaSnrq%2B%2Fxaippqtdna6tuNaasGarpJq7pLXLaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charles-m-rice.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charles M.
