Further, he added that he and his wife were tired of this.</p><p>All the people who have been trying to break or crush their relationship didn’t want to shut up any further. So, Vuolo added that faith and love never end or crash no matter how hard a third party wants.</p><p>After making these statements, the couple made a final tweet and ended it up.</p><p>And to the people spreading unnecessary rumors were all attention seekers. Now, about the cheating rumor, Duggar begged her fans to stop it because she was done with it.</p><p>Despite all the negativity, the couple added that their relationship stays strong as they have a deep faith in each other.</p><h3>Josh Duggar’s Case&nbsp;</h3><p>Recently, in May 2021, Jeremy Vuolo’s brother-in-law fell into a controversial abyss. Apparently, Josh is charged with child pornography charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Herewith, Jeremy stood out for him claiming the justice to prevail.&nbsp;</p><p>“Nothing can prepare someone to receive news like that. Like everyone else, we are absolutely horrified and want to see justice carried out. And we just want to say that we are grateful for the authorities who work tirelessly to end child abuse here and around the world.” -Jeremy Vuolo</p><p>For a short background, Josh was first arrested on April 29 and has pleaded not guilty to the charges. As of now, Josh is out of jail but under the supervision of third-party custody.&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether, his hearing is this July 1st while the trial is on July 6th.
