The billionaire, 51, flexed his arms and looked like he was shouting as he posed for a photo on the red carpet, in full-on samurai gear. It seemed like he was in a celebratory mood, after he finalized his deal to buy Twitter the week before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elon-musk-halloween-2022-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Elon seemed like he was wearing casual clothes under the costume. The samurai gear was deep, blood-red and had a goat printed on the front. His costume was complete with wristguards and leg coverings. Besides the shot where he looked like he was yelling, there was another photo where he simply smirked and looked happy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Elon’s date for the party was his mom&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Maye</a>,&nbsp;</strong>who also accompanied him to the Met Gala back in September. It wasn’t as clear what her costume was supposed to be, but she wore a leather trenchcoat and high-heeled black boots with red laces. She also appeared to have some of her hair dyed black, so maybe it was a modern&nbsp;Cruella Deville look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elon-musk-halloween-2022-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Elon had shared a photo of him and his mom as well as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>another woman</a> before heading off to the party on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. He also posted a photo of him getting out of a car in his costume. “Halloween with my mom,” he wrote along with the photo.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Halloween party came shortly after Elon’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>controversial acquisition</a> of Twitter. The night before Elon went to Heidi’s party, he was also a guest at&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bella Thorne’s</a>&nbsp;</strong>party on Sunday evening. A guest at the party revealed to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>exclusively that the Tesla founder was happy to “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>openly” discuss his plans for Twitter</a> with the guests. “Elon’s appearance had everyone talking and so many guests there were asking him <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>questions about Twitter,</a>” the source said. “He was speaking about it openly and it was clear he was super proud of taking ownership of Twitter. He seemed very emotionally invested in it. No one was coming for him or trying to get into an argument. Rather, it was very mature conversations that were taking place, where Elon was listening to people’s thoughts, and you could tell he was genuinely interested.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49qZp6kn6N6rsHSpGSsmZ2qv6K1jKGYpaSfrLKmuoycpqyspaKybn6Pa2lmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-mosbys-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Mosbys Boyfriend: Who is Taylor Mosby Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joshua-suarez-19960602-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joshua Suarez (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
