The game comes with an impressive board with many pieces, most of which are zombies on little plastic stands.</p><p>The game’s main objective is to outlive the zombie apocalypse and establish a society. The board game, however, does not have much combat situation. It is a fun game that involves diplomacy, negotiation, and betrayal.</p><p>The setup is of a city with a zombie outbreak, and each player will control three to five survivors. The players hide in various buildings waiting to be rescued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/City-of-Horror.jpg><p>Similarly, the player has to keep their survivors alive throughout the four hours of the night. However, it is not an easy task as the buildings will eventually run out of space, and someone will have to be ejected.</p><p>A voting process among the fellow players decides which player is to be tossed out of the building. What might look like an alliance could eventually end up in betrayal.</p><p>The run time for the game is around 90 minutes, where the players will debate, make deals and alliances, trade items, etc. The game is best played between entire groups of five to six players.</p><p>The board game will provide exciting gameplay for zombie lovers as they try to survive the brain-eating miscreants.</p><p><a href=#>People love mysteries.
