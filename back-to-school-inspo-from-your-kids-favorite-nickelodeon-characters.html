If your kids aren't sure where to begin, never fear! All the most fashionable <a href=#>Nickelodeon</a> characters are here to help provide some fashion inspiration. From Jade West to Henry Danger, there's no shortage of ideas for outfits far beyond the first day of school.&nbsp;And to stay inspired, all of these great hit shows and all-time classics are available to stream now on <a href=#>Paramount+</a>.<p><strong>SIGN UP NOW: <a href=#>Get Paramount+ To Enjoy All The Sartorial Splendor&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p><img align alt fid=1153725 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/54108eaaf2daabab_fun_socks.png vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Fun Socks (Inspired by Spencer from <a href=#>iCarly</a>)</strong><br>Looking for something subtle—yet fun—to brighten up a look? Spencer has the right idea with his colorful and unique socks. There is no shortage of patterns and designs that will match any interest, personality, or outfit—each and every day. Whether mismatched or identical, fun socks are a great way for your kid to embrace their creative side and show what makes them smile. Plus, fun socks are a conversation starter! They'll be a great way for your kid to bond and talk about something unique with other kids who also love a little creativity.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 1, Episode 2 of iCarly, "iWant More Viewers"</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><img align alt fid=1153726 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/3cd15cd101598e96_hawaiian_shirts.png vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Hawaiian Shirts (Inspired by Gibby from <a href=#>iCarly</a>)</strong><br>There's no better way to make a statement than a pop of color. Hawaiian shirts (a.k.a. Aloha shirts) are bright, and come in an endless variety of patterns and colors, so your kid will never run out of options! There are even Hawaiian shirts that incorporate popular Nickelodeon characters, like SpongeBob SquarePants, so your kid can rock their favorite characters while being inspired by them as well. They can be kept unbuttoned and worn over another shirt, or buttoned all the way up as its own statement. Gibby may not always&nbsp;wear shirts, but when he does, Hawaiian shirts are the way to go. Why not pretend to have some fun in the sun even while inside a classroom?<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 3, Episode 9 of iCarly, "iOMG"</a></strong></p><p><img align alt fid=1153729 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/0f423886154f7dc3_oversized_sweatshirts.png vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Oversized Sweatshirts (Inspired by Henry Hart from <a href=#>Henry Danger</a>)</strong><br>Nobody needs a broken arm to wear an oversized sweatshirt (nice try, Henry). This choice is super comfy, warm, and perfect for a long day of tests, projects, and anything else a school might serve up. Able to be paired with any kind of pants or shorts, the fashion possibilities are endless. Kids can also sneak a t-shirt underneath for gym class, or an extra layer just in case the classroom gets a little warm. Whether the sweatshirt has horses or something else your kid loves, they will sail through the day, and have no need to change when they chill on the couch when they get home.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 5, Episode 9 of Henry Danger, "Broken Armed And Dangerous"</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><img align alt fid=1153730 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/e43cead115b78969_sweatpants.png vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Sweatpants and Boots (Inspired by Harper from the new <a href=#>iCarly</a>)</strong><br>If your kids likes comfort on top, they'll have to have comfort on the bottom. Harper from the new iCarly has the look covered! Not only is she a professional stylist in the making, she is also the queen of fashionable comfort, with sweatpants tucked into boots being a signature look. Soft, warm, and dozens of sweatpant patterns to choose from, this combo is the perfect mixture of creativity and loungewear. Pair with a t-shirt (or if really looking for comfort, an oversized sweatshirt) for a total look that'll make any chair comfortable.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 1, Episode 9 of the new iCarly, "iMLM"</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><img align alt fid=1153727 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/0535f2c758d252fb_layered_looks.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Layered Looks On Top (Inspired by Andre and Beck from <a href=#>Victorious</a>)&nbsp;</strong><br>Flannel and jean and leather, oh my! When layering is involved, the possibilities are endless. A flannel can be left open with a t-shirt, buttoned up on its own, tied around the waist '90s style, OR just one of several layers in a single look. These are just a few of the many styles Beck and Andre sported throughout their time at Hollywood Arts. When the fall weather settles in, jean and leather jackets are the perfect layer choices (possibly over that flannel?). Paired with leggings, jeans, sneakers, boots, or anything else your kid can think of, layered looks are super easy to mix and match, creating multiple outfits built around one article of clothing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 1, Episode 19 of Victorious, "Freak The Freak Out - Part 1"</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><img align alt fid=1153728 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/21ef093864ad2ed6_layered_looks_2.png vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Layered Looks On Bottom (Inspired by Jade from <a href=#>Victorious</a>)&nbsp;</strong><br>Jackets aren't the only thing your kid can layer, mix, and match. Jade is the queen of strutting through the halls with her dress/skirt, legging, and boot triple threat. Paired with a sweater, this look is simple and really comfortable. Even incorporate some layering on the top with a t-shirt and a leather or jean jacket. Once again, the possibilities are endless when your kid layers their way to success.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 3, Episode 20 of Victorious, "Tori Fixes Beck & Jade"</a></strong></p><p><img align alt fid=1153723 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/4503eb7787766f26_accessories.png vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Accessories (Inspired by everyone!)&nbsp;</strong><br>There is more to an outfit than just the essentials. Accessories are a great way to bring an outfit together. Other than jewelry, headbands, and nail polish, there are other ways to accessorize a look, especially in school. Putting pins on a backpack, creating a personalized binder or notebook, or even having a decorated locker like the gang in <a href=#>Victorious</a> can help your kid feel confident, unique, and ready to tackle the day.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the world we live in today, masks have also become a fashion statement, and this accessory can take the form of any pattern, design, or favorite character. Like fun socks, masks are also a great conversation starter, making sure smiles still shine bright from behind them.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>STREAM: <a href=#>Season 1, Episode 2 of Victorious, "The Bird Scene"</a></strong><br>&nbsp;<br><img align alt fid=1153724 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/98/20/3e6f32da45b841cf_accessories_2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Want some more inspo?
