Even rarer are those that provide multiple top-level athletes.</p><p>Likewise, one such family produced not one, not two, but three NHL players are the Strome family. And amongst those three brothers, <strong>Ryan Strome</strong> is the one that is flying the Strome flag high.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-896.jpg><p>Even though Ryan is only 26 years old, he has played professionally for almost a decade, showing his incredible abilities.</p><p>Added to that, Ryan is finally starting to hit his peak years, which means that his performances will grow even better. As a result, we have full confidence in the Ontario native to become one of the NHL’s best players.</p><p>However, we are not here to discuss the future. Instead, we are here to tell you about Strome’s early life to his current days with the New York Rangers.</p><p>You will also find information regarding his net worth, salary, spouse, brothers, age, height, and social media.</p><p>But before we get onto the serious stuff, let’s look at the quick facts.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody readability=9.6367763904654><tr readability=2><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Ryan Edward Gaston Strome</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>11 July 1993</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Mississauga, Ontario, Canada</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>&nbsp;Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Chris Strome</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Trish Strome</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Dylan Strome, Matthew Strome</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>30 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>6’1″ (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>200 lbs (93 kg)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><b>Fiancee</b></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Sydney Turner</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Center/Right-Wing</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Ice Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr readability=8><td><strong>Clubs&nbsp;</strong></td><td>New York Rangers (Current); Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders, Bridgeport Sound Tigers, Niagara IceDogs, Barrie Colts, Toronto Marlboros (Former)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jersey Number</strong></td><td>16 (New York Rangers)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=#>Twitter</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.72727272727273><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Trading Cards</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Hockey Gears</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>January, 2024</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ryan Strome: Early Life & Brothers</h2><p>Ryan Edward Gaston Strome was born to his parents, <strong>Chris Strome</strong> and <strong>Trish Strome,</strong> on 11 July 1993 in Mississauga, Ontario because&nbsp;ice hockey is the national sport of Canada, and most kids dream of playing in the NHL.</p><p>Added to that, it is the pinnacle of ice hockey, so all Ryan could ever dream of was being a professional ice hockey player in the NHL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-897.jpeg><p>Therefore, to achieve his dreams, Strome would spend hours on the ice rink practicing with his brothers, <strong>Dylan Strome</strong> and <strong>Matthew Strome</strong>. Extraordinarily, all three brothers now play in the NHL, which is mind-boggling.</p><p>But returning to the subject, the three brothers used to compete viciously as no one was willing to give an inch. Every victory had to be earned amongst the brothers, and that’s why those three became what they are now.</p><h2>Ryan Strome: Career & Trade</h2><p>What most people don’t know is that Ryan started his professional career in the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL) and not the National Hockey League (NHL).</p><p>He spent a year with Toronto Marlboros, in which he appeared 76 times and scored 85 goals, 164 points, and assisted 79 times.</p><p>Following his impressive performances, Strome got drafted as the eighth overall pick by the Barrie Colts at the Ontario Hockey League Draft.</p><p>But he got traded a year later to Niagara IceDogs because of his underwhelming performances for the Colts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-898.jpg><p>Subsequently, the 27-year-old stayed with the IceDogs for four years, in which they reached the playoffs all four times.</p><p>During his time with the Niagara IceDogs, Ryan appeared in 235 matches scoring 115 goals, 323 points, and assisting&nbsp;207 times.</p><p>The Ontario native also won the OHL Player of the Month in January 2011 while also being selected for the 2011 Second All-Star Team.</p><p>All in all, Strome’s time with the IceDogs turned out to be a huge stepping stone in his career because soon after his impressive 2011 season with the franchise, he got selected as the fifth overall pick in the 2011 NHL Draft by the New York Islanders.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith Tkachuk Bio: Net Worth, Salary, Age, Career, Stats, Kids Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Although the Islanders drafted the Ontario native, Ryan still had some years left on his IceDogs contract. To fulfill those contractual obligations, Strome went back to Niagara and spent the next two years honing and developing his skills.</p><p>By the time his contract was finished with the IceDogs, the 27-year-old was one of the OHL’s best players. Therefore, everyone expected Strome to replicate his OHL form.</p><p>However, the Islanders knew that putting Ryan straight into the team could be risky as he had not proven himself in the tougher leagues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-899.jpg><p>Thus, the Ontario native was sent to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, who played in the American Hockey League (AHL) for the 2012-13 season.</p><p>It was not even halfway through the season when Islanders decided to call him back. At that time, Ryan was leading the AHL in points, which made the decision even better.</p><p>After that, Strome spent the next four years with the New York-based franchise, in which they reached the playoffs four times.</p><p>Added to that, Ryan Strome&nbsp;scored 60 goals, and 134 points,&nbsp;and provided 86 assists in his 273 appearances for the Islanders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-900.jpg><p>However, the Ontario native got traded to the Edmonton Oilers in the 2017-18 season as he failed to show his true potential.</p><p>Subsequently, Ryan performed admirably for his new team as he appeared in all 82 games scoring 13 goals, and&nbsp;34 points,&nbsp;and providing 21 assists for his teammates.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erling Haaland Bio: Stats, Father, Goals, Contract, TransferMarkt Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Following his commendable first year with the Oilers, Strome earned a new two-year <strong>$6.2 million contract</strong> with the franchise.</p><p>It seemed like Ryan had finally found his true home, but sadly he was traded just four months later to the New York Rangers.</p><p>After that, Ryan&nbsp;played in 63 games for the Rangers scoring 18 goals and 33 points and providing 15 assists during the 2018-19 season.</p><p>Although his first season with the New York-based franchise was acceptable, fans and pundits alike thought that Strome could do much better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-901.jpg><p>And that is what Ryan is doing this season as he has appeared 70 times for the Rangers, scoring 18 goals and 59 points along with 41 assists, which is a significant improvement compared to his previous season.</p><p>But due to the world pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19), all the major sporting leagues around the world have been postponed, including the NHL.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have full faith in Strome to continue his excellent form whenever the league resumes. And at just 27 years of age, the sky is the limit for the Ontario native as he has almost a decade left in his young body.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Although Ryan has not made any senior team appearances for the Canadian national team, he has appeared in three different tournaments for Canada’s youth-level sides.</p><p>To explain, Ryan Strome&nbsp;played in the 2010 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, where he won the silver medal.</p><p>Also, Strome played in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Junior Championships (WJC) in the years 2012 and 2013, winning the bronze in 2012 and finishing fourth the next year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/strome-902.jpg><p>To conclude, Ryan is a talented individual who is an extremely dedicated and work-oriented person. But due to his young age and intense competition in the center position for Canada, Strome has not been able to make a senior team appearance.</p><p>Nevertheless, no one will be surprised when the 27-year-old eventually makes that long-awaited debut for the Canadian national team.</p><h2>Ryan Strome: Age, Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in the year 1993 makes, Ryan is 27&nbsp;years currently, which is very young for a player who has been playing professional hockey for almost a decade.</p><p>Furthermore, ice hockey players tend to play till their mid 30’s, which means that Ryan&nbsp;still has another 10 years left in his body.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergei Fedorov Bio: Net Worth, Salary, Wife, Career, Achievements Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Likewise, the Ontario native stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 200 lb (91 kg).</p><p>It is the perfect height-to-weight ratio for a player who plays in the center position as centers need to be strong while also being fast skaters who can check back quickly from offense to help out the defense.</p><h3>Injury</h3><p>Ryan Strome is a bit lucky in a case that he hasn’t faced numerous injuries throughout his career. Back in March 2017, one of his injuries was that he broke his right-hand wrist.</p><p>To illustrate, he fell into the injury during the second period of the match between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers. During the match, he had his hand awkwardly stuck and hit by the Rangers defenseman, <a href=#>Brady Skjei</a>.</p><p>Back then, Strome left the game and, thus, had to return to the bench. Overall, before he came to the Islanders, Strome did a thorough checkup, including X-rays and MRIs for selection.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>You might be interested in Ryan Strome’s autographed items like jerseys, cards, and many more; click to follow.&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2>Ryan Strome: Net Worth & CapFriendly</h2><p>As of 2021, Strome’s net worth stands at a staggering <strong>$8 million,</strong> accrued mainly through his NHL career.</p><p>However, Ryan’s net worth should come as no surprise as he has been involved in professional ice hockey for a decade.
