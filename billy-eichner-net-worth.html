The openly gay quadruple threat (he also writes and produces) grew his following as the host of Funny or Die‚Äôs Billy on the Street.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>In September 2022, Billy released his project <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bros</a>. The actor wrote and starred in the <a href=#>LGBTQ</a> romantic comedy alongside <a href=#>Luke McFarlane</a>. Although the film provided its audience with a new take on a traditional movie genre, it didn‚Äôt receive the box office success Billy and his team possibly hoped for. However, his net worth proves he can afford to start over with another film if he chooses to do so.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Billy Eichner‚Äôs net worth?</h2><p>Billy earned a net worth of $5 million through his writing, hosting, and acting work. Born and raised in New York City, he developed a passion for the arts and knew he wanted to study acting. In 2000, Billy did just that and attended Northwestern University, where he earned a BS in theater.</p><p>After college, Billy began hosting around NYC and eventually made his rounds in the industry. In 2005, he wrote and created Creation Nation: A Live Talk Show, which caught Bravo‚Äôs attention. Soon, Billy started getting booked on shows like My Life on the Z-List: Jen's Vlog and Straight Talk with <a href=#>Joan Rivers</a>.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While his Bravo affiliations grew Billy‚Äôs fan base, his show, Billy on the Street, catapulted his fame. On the show, Billy interviewed celebrities like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone</a> and Chris Evans and asked them hilariously inappropriate questions on the street. The show started in 2011 and took a three-year hiatus starting in December 2019, but Billy brought it back with an interview with Paul Rudd, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Billy on the Street seemingly launched Billy‚Äôs acting career. In 2013, he landed a guest spot on Parks and Rec and had a two-year run on the Amy Poehler-led series. The actor‚Äôs other film and TV credits include American Horror Story, Friends from College, and the live-action adaptation of The Lion King as Timon.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Billy Eichener</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actor, Comedian, Writer, Producer</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $5 million</p><p>Billy Eichner rose to fame with his 2011 comedy series, Billy on the Street.

The movie starred Billy and Luke as two gay men struggling with commitment. Three years later, Bros premiered in movie theaters and included several LGBTQ actors like TS Madison, <a href=#>Miss Lawrence</a> of Real Housewives of Atlanta fame, Monica Raymund, and Scandal‚Äôs Guillermo D√≠az.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>Following its release, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported that Bros had ‚Äúunderperforming‚Äù numbers at the box office on its opening weekend. The outlet stated the movie earned $4.8 million, which was reportedly half of what Universal Studios projected.</p><p>On Monday, Oct. 3, Billy addressed the low ratings on Twitter. In his first tweet, the Bob‚Äôs Burgers star said the box office ‚Äúhas absolutely nothing to do with the quality of a movie.‚Äù He also called out the ‚ÄúTwitter bulls--t‚Äù he saw about the movie soon after it came out.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And yes I‚Äôm going to continue tweeting about Bros every day for the next year just to spite you! üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èGO BROS!!!

Really. I am VERY proud of this movie.‚Äù</p><p>The actor continued: ‚ÄúEven with glowing reviews, great Rotten Tomatoes scores, an A CinemaScore, etc., straight people, especially in certain parts of the country, just didn‚Äôt show up for Bros. And that‚Äôs disappointing, but it is what it is.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rolling Stone already has BROS on the list of the best comedies of the 21st century. What‚Äôs also true is that at one point a theater chain called Universal and said they were pulling the trailer because of the gay content. (Uni convinced them not to).
