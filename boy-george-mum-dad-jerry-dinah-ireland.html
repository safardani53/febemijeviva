The middle child is always deranged. My brother Kevin, who was born the year after me, was born with tapeworm and nearly died.</p><p>"For about two years I was kind of not that important. I don't know whether that had a profound effect on me.</p><p>"All I remember about being a child is being quite independent. I used to go off a lot and walk for miles and, from about 11, I remember discovering where David Bowie lived and I used to go and sit outside his house.</p><p>"I wasn't interested in the sort of things my brothers were interested in. They liked Farrah Fawcett-Majors and beautiful girls and I liked Bowie, jewellery and Busby Berkeley.</p><p>"Family to me is stability, it's reliability.</p><p>"Yes, it's often dysfunctional but I love my family very much and I'm really grateful that I've got a big family because there's always somebody who can pull you back to earth – always somebody to remind you who you really are.
