Although she said she “loved” having the opportunity to be at the table with the other women, she admitted there was some tension between them. “I sought to make peace with Rosie O’Donnell and Rosie Perez,” she explained. “I had such a special friendship with Whoopi Goldberg.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nicolle-wallace-fired-the-view-nbc-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here are five things you should know about Nicolle and her impressive career since being let go from The View.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>1. She was called a “3rd rate lap dog” by President Donald Trump.</strong> The cable news anchor defended former Vice President <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a> in a segment on Deadline: White House on May 1, and in response, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Trump</a> directed a string of insults at her, MSNBC and its parent company, Comcast, which he misspelled as Concast. “She was thrown off&nbsp;The View like a dog, Zero T.V. Personas. Now Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn’t have what it takes!” the POTUS tweeted on May 2.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><b>2. Her commentary about the assault allegation leveled against Joe Biden led to Trump’s Twitter attack.</b> During a May 1 panel discussion on MSNBC about Joe’s interview on the network earlier that morning, Nicolle said, “Having once been a member of the Republican party, the right isn’t running an intellectually honest operation to get to the bottom of whether&nbsp;<strong>Tara Reade</strong> was victimized. The right is running a smear campaign against Joe Biden.” Conservative author and Fox News host <strong>Mark Levin</strong> criticized Nicolle for accusing the right of trying to “smear” Joe Biden. Trump then responded to Mark’s tweet with his own attack on the cable news anchor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>3. Nicolle has worked in The White House.</strong> She previously served as the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>White House</a> Communications Director for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>George W. Bush</strong></a> and was a senior advisor for <strong>John McCain</strong>’s 2008 presidential campaign. She served as “a voice for more openness with reporters” according to reports in The Washington Post, and former colleagues described her as having been “very persuasive in the halls of the West Wing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nicolle-wallace-fired-the-view-nbc-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>4. She is a staunch critic of the Trump administration.</strong> Despite her political affiliations with the Republican Party in the past, Nicolle has been one of the Trump administration’s strongest critics since he took office in 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>5. Nicolle is a frequent contributor on many MSNBC programs.&nbsp;</strong>Along with her position as the anchor of&nbsp;Deadline: White House,&nbsp;which she has held since 2017, Nicolle also contributes to, and guest hosts programs like&nbsp;The 11th Hour With Brian Williams, Morning Joe,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Today Show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K7qq%2FOpaOeZaeWua2twp5kq52gpL%2B1sdFma2lsYG2CcXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ron-bushys-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ron Bushy Dating Ron Bushy's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-joshua-gomez-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Joshua Gomez Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
