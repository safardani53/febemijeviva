"We want all of you to watch it with us."&nbsp;</p><p>While fans were hoping the two would announce a reboot of the popular show, it can't be ruled out completely. David told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2019 that the pair talk about it "all the time."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While many Disney Channel co-stars seemingly moved on from their childhood acting friends, Selena and David have stayed close.

While Selena was involved with Justin Bieber on-and-off for nearly a decade, she has been linked to other people in between. So, did an on-set romance develop between these two celebs?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>According to Seventeen, Selena and David were spotted on numerous dates in 2010 and were also photographed grabbing dinner in 2014. However, while there have been rumors surrounding their relationship, they have not confirmed that their friendship was anything more than platonic. Overall, it just seems like they're really great friends that have each other's backs. So much so that Selena even third-wheeled on one of David's dates!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2018, David posted a photo of him and wife Maria Cahill drinking wine ... and Selena was spotted in the background. "Alex always crashing the party," he jokingly captioned the photo, referencing the "Rare" singer's Wizards of Waverly Place character.</p><p>We totally love their friendship, and hopefully we'll get to see the Russos back in action!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who has Selena Gomez dated? Here's a look at her past relationships.</h2><p>Since starring in the hit Disney series, and dating one of the biggest pop stars ever, <a href=#>Selena's love life</a> has been subjected to tabloid fodder. While we've gotten glimpses of what transpired between her and ex-beau Justin Bieber, who is now married to Hailey Baldwin, Sel has mainly kept mum on her other relationships.</p><p>Though she appears to be enjoying the single life, Selena has previously dated The Weeknd, Taylor Lautner, and Charlie Puth. She has also been linked to Orlando Bloom and Zedd.&nbsp;</p><p>Opening up to Zane Lowe about dating in Hollywood, Selena explained, “Everyone dates everyone. It always seems to be within this little bubble and it's because it's safe, right? You know, you're wanting someone to understand what you’re going through. You're almost wanting a counterpart of creativity as well and it's, you know, interesting and fun." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She added, "But the problem with that is that you end up — whether you admit it or not — you're having a relationship for people and not even for yourself. There's almost this point where it's like 'we're making it known that we're together or whatever it is.' You just need to decide within our world if it's for you or is it for show?" &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbrDAr6CdZZiau7O1xGabmqyVmQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bill-freehan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Bill Freehan net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paige-doherty-john-leathem-channel-5-show-murder-next-door.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chilling moment Paige Dohertys killer John Leathem calmly denies murdering teen in unseen police</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
