But does NXIVM leader <a href=#>Keith Raniere</a> have children himself?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Raniere — who is <a href=#>serving a 120-year prison sentence</a> after being convicted in 2019 of racketeering, sex trafficking, and other offenses — has at least two children. And that info comes straight from court documents Raniere and his legal team filed after his 2018 arrest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do we know about Keith Raniere's children?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Keith Raniere has a teenage son who reportedly went into hiding. In 2014, a lawyer for a woman named Kristin M. Keeffe said that Keeffe was in hiding amid a custody dispute with Raniere over her son, Gaelyn, as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Times Union</a> reported at the time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The newspaper also reported that Keeffe, then 44, had spent “more than half her life associated with Raniere” and lived with him for years in a housing complex in Halfmoon, N.Y. And when she became a mother around eight years before the Times Union report, she moved into a unit two doors away from Raniere’s.</p><p>At some point, though, the relationship between Raniere and Keeffe went south. “I have completely left NXIVM and New York,” Keeffe allegedly wrote to a lawyer for the Cult Education Institute, an organization that was involved in a legal battle with NXIVM at the time. “The state police arranged a series of safe houses for me to stay in with Gaelyn, and they moved us out of the Northeast. I have full sole legal custody of Gaelyn. Keith was experimenting on him. I had to get Gaelyn away.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2020, investigative journalist Frank Parlato — who covered NXIVM on his blog Frank Report — told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxygen.com</a> that Keeffe and her son, who was then 13, were “doing well” and living in the Northeast. “They’re still somewhat in hiding because of Raniere’s dangerous attributes,” Parlato added.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Additionally, a court document revealed that Raniere welcomed a son just months before his arrest.</h2><p>Court documents the Daily Mail obtained in 2018 revealed that Raniere also had an infant son at the time who was living with his mother in Mexico. The child was 7 months old when Raniere was arrested, and the boy’s mother is a woman named Mariana Fernandez. Raniere also said that he had an older child who was 11 at the time — presumably Gaelyn — with whom he did not have contact.</p><p>In the documents, Raniere’s legal team mentioned his infant son in reference to a proposal for the NXIVM leader’s bail arrangement. “[Raniere] would have access to a computer and telephone, but the computer would lack internet access and would be used only to review materials related to this case, and the telephone would be used only to make and receive calls to and from phone numbers agreed to by the Government, including those of his counsel and the mother of his child,” the document read.</p><p>NXIVM documentary The Vow Part II airs Monday nights at 9 p.m. on HBO and streams on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKqwMdmqZqmmZq%2FpnnCoaClnKKauw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./micah-solis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Micah Solis- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-paquin-and-stephen-moyer-flack.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Flack' Star Anna Paquin and Husband Stephen Moyer Could Reunite On-Screen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
