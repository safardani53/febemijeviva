Rodrigo, 19, explained to viewers that this was the same route she took while writing and recording SOUR.</p><p>Along the way, the songstress made various stops to play new arrangements of her songs “in these places that meant so much to me.” The 77-minute-long film took fans through the process of making SOUR from the first song she wrote for the record — “Happier” — to the last — “Hope Ur OK.”</p><p>Of course, she also reflected on the worldwide success of her debut single “Drivers License” and the drama that followed. Professionally, Rodrigo&nbsp;explained that “one week” after the song was released, she made the decision to record the full album. Personally, she could have never imagined what would come as <a href=#>fans decoded the lyrics</a>.</p><p>Eagle-eyed HSMTMTS fans had <a href=#>theorized that the song</a> was about her split from costar Bassett, 21. Although the Disney+ stars never publicly confirmed their relationship, viewers were convinced that they were together while starring in the show’s first season.</p><p>Specifically, listeners homed in on one line of lyrics that read: “And you’re probably with that blonde girl / Who always made me doubt.”</p><p>At the time, Bassett had been spotted with<a href=#><strong> Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a> — who happens to be blonde — so fans were convinced Rodrigo was singing about her apparent ex and his rumored flame.</p><p>“I totally understand people’s curiosity with the specifics of who the song’s about and what it’s about, but to me, that’s really the least important part of the song,” Rodrigo told <a href=#>Billboard</a> after the song came out. “It’s resonating with people because of how emotional it is, and I think everything else is not important.”</p><p>As Rodrigo, Bassett and Carpenter, 22, (<a href=#>her song “Skin”</a> was rumored to be a direct response) continued to release new music, the drama didn’t die down. In fact, months after SOUR came out, she spoke further after the aftermath of “Drivers License.”</p><p>“I put it out not knowing that it would get that reaction, so it was really strange [when] it did. I just remember [everyone being] so weird and speculative about stuff they had no idea about,” Rodrigo told <a href=#>Variety</a> in August 2021. “I don’t really subscribe to hating other women because of boys. I think that’s so stupid, and I really resent that narrative that was being tossed around.”</p><p>Bassett, for his part, waited nearly a year to tell his truth. <a href=#>He appeared to address</a> the entire situation, noting “it’s not as recent as it seems,” in a December 2021 interview with <a href=#>GQ</a> amid the release of his songs <a href=#>“Crisis,” “Secret” and “Set Me Free.”</a> In the same magazine article, he claimed, “[Rodrigo] hasn’t spoken to me since ‘Drivers License’ came out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In Driving Home 2 U, Rodrigo may not have addressed anyone by name, but she did speak at length about the past relationship that inspired SOUR and talked about the “Drivers License” drama head on.</p><p><strong>Keep scrolling for the biggest takeaways.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvK211aKYZqqfmb%2Bqs85mmJ2coprAtLHSZpuroaaav7R5y6KanqajmnqlvsCmmGahnmLAsMHRZqSorpmafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhoa-kenya-moore-weight-gain-quarantine.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RHOA star Kenya Moore proudly shows off new body after she gained 25 pounds in quarantine</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marvel-stars-who-dated-each-other.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marvel Stars Who Dated Each Other</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
