The insider noted that the family members were “all just listening and waiting and hoping” to hear from Bell, who shares a son with estranged wife <strong>Janet Von Schmeling</strong>. (Schmeling moved to Florida with their child, whom they welcomed in 2021, after their split.)</p><p>Bell, for his part, <a href=#>appeared to brush off the incident</a> when he broke his silence Thursday night.</p><p>“You leave your phone in the car and don’t answer for the night and this? ￼😂,“ he quipped via <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Von Schmeling, meanwhile, took to social media on Friday to share a clip of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s “You Need to Calm Down” — with no further explanation.</p><p>“Say it in the street that’s a knockout / But you say it in a tweet, that’s cop out,” the lyrics flashed across the screen in her Instagram Story. “‘And I’m just like, ‘Hey’ / ‘Are you OK?’”</p><p>Bell and Von Schmeling tied the knot in 2018 and went on to welcome their son in July 2021 — the same month that the Yours, Mine & Ours actor was <a href=#>sentenced to two years of probation</a> and 200 hours of community service in California after he pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted endangering children and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles in 2017.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amid his probation, Us exclusively obtained photos of Bell <a href=#>appearing to huff on balloons</a> on two separate occasions in December 2022. One month later, <a href=#>he and Von Schmeling called it quits</a>.</p><p>If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the <a href=#>Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a> at 988.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpGgsm6uxKWjZnFhZnqkrculZKmnnJ6wpnnOn52im5WneqexwKucnWWYmnq4rdJmqq6hk56xoriO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dua-lipa-pink-bikini-cowboy-hat-pool-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dua Lipa Rocks Pink Bikini &amp;amp; Cowboy Hat In The Pool Photo Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dog-runs-in-sleep-crashes-into-wall.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dog Runs in Sleep, Crashes Into Wall</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
