This was right after her father, <a href=# rel=follow>Judd Apatow</a>, deleted tweets about&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Chris Rock and Will Smith's slap incident</a> at the 2022 Oscars. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>People dug out one of Maude's old tweets where she apparently admitted racism. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Maude Apatow's Old Tweet Mixed with Racism</h2><p>In 2011, Apatow, who was just 13, tweeted something seemingly innocent. She <a href=# rel="follow noopener">shared her thoughts</a> about the political environment during her childhood. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>"I'm at that age where everything you say is either incredibly racist or extremely inappropriate," her tweet read, made on May 17, 2011.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Maude Apatow's deleted tweet from 2011, which she is now getting termed racist for.</strong> (Photo: Pop Crave/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This tweet resurfaced on March 28, 2022, and many people started calling her a racist. In their interpretation, the tweet was her admitting&nbsp;she had said racist and/or insensitive things in the past.</p><p>After fans implored&nbsp;her to clear the controversy, Maude responded. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Regarding her tweet and what she meant by it, she stated, "I meant that everyone at my age was terrible!!!" The actress deleted that tweet,&nbsp;which also enraged a few others.</p><p>They opined she should not have done so. However, in Maude's defense, some&nbsp;people said she was right to remove the tweet as it was being used to hate on her.</p><p>A few&nbsp;also wanted&nbsp;to know her thoughts on her father Judd's tweets about&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Chris Rock</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Will Smith</a>'s spat at the Oscars. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After all, the&nbsp;tweet had resurfaced right after her father, Judd, tweeted and deleted some controversial words about the recent Oscars controversy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>What Did Judd Apatow's Deleted Tweets Say?</h2><p>Judd took to Twitter to condemn Will's violence toward Chris. However, while everyone&nbsp;said things opposing Will and his actions, Judd took the condemning to the next level.</p><p>He wrote a few tweets and responded to a few others in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">outlandish manners</a>, some of which were interpreted as having racist connotations. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In one of his tweets, he wrote, "He could have killed him. That's pure out of control rage and violence," referring to Will's outburst on stage.</p><p>Further, he said Will and <a href=# rel=follow>Jada Pinkett Smith</a> were not new to Hollywood and comedy and that the <a href=# rel=follow>King Richard</a> actor had "lost his mind."</p><p>In another response, he said Will displayed "Pure Narcissism" by trying to shut down jokes about him and his family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The public took issue with a few things in his comments. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The first was the alleged racist implications of his tweet. "Judd Apatow saying Will Smith could have killed Chris Rock feels like some weird&nbsp;Black men are so scary&nbsp;bullsh*t," one user wrote.</p><p>They also termed his tweets "more dramatic" than Will's outburst.</p><p>Judd's hyperbole in saying Will could have killed Chris got serious flack. People were calling him out for saying outrageous things and not thinking twice before going on social media.</p><p>Soon after the backlash started, Judd deleted all these tweets. But users on Twitter kept screenshots of the deleted tweets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWRqrGmecCpmK2np2K3trDDZpipmaSkxG6%2BwJygrKVencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sister-wives-recap-meri-miscarriage-kody-brown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meri Browns Sad Secret Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heron-preston.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heron Preston</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
