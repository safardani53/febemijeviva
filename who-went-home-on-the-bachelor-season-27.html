However, now that it's here and nearing its finale, we're loving it. Between the quirky group of 30 women and Zach’s dedication to "the process" (despite kissing almost every woman in the house on night one), there's a lot to enjoy about Season 27.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>One thing that will never change from season to season, however, is that only one person can be with the bachelor in the end. This makes for some very dramatic turns from week to week as more women get sent home each episode.</p><p>So, who went home on <a href=#>The Bachelor Season 27</a>? Read on to find out more!</p><p><strong>*SPOILERS FOR WEEK 9 BELOW*</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2>Who went home on 'The Bachelor'?</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 9 — March 20, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Week 9 of Zach's season of The Bachelor marks the much-anticipated Fantasy Suite dates. Zach goes against his previous "no sex" rule and sleeps with one of the women, Gabi, though when he tells the other women, Gabi isn't thrilled.</p><p>At the final rose ceremony, despite Zach previously telling April he sees a future with her, he sends her home in an emotional goodbye. But April's hope for finding someone to put her first could mean she that Bachelor in Paradise is in her future.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 8 — March 13, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hometown dates are finally here in Week 8. It's the final elimination before fantasy suite dates and only one woman goes home.</p><p>The only issue with <a href=#>Charity</a> and Zach's hometown date is her family's concern that she's not ready to potentially get hurt again after suffering a difficult breakup.</p><p>In the end, despite Charity admitting she's falling in love with him, Zach sends her home. It's an emotional goodbye, but one that happens because Zach follows his "gut."</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 7 — March 6, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Greer makes a full COVID-19 recovery, but all is not well with Zach. Their time apart meant the feelings dissolved for Zach and he sends her home outside of a date.</p><p>Brooklyn and Zach have a one-on-one date and, despite her opening up about her family to him, he doesn't feel "fully confident" in what they have.

She brings up her fears to Zach, who tries to console her and tell her it's not about one-on-ones, but it's about quality time together.</p><p>Even still, this doesn't appease her, and when Zach says he feels a "disconnect," Jess saves herself the trouble and chooses to go home. <a href=#>Aly Jacobs</a>, on the other hand, had a great start with Zach, but their connection just wasn't strong enough.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 5 — Feb. 20, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The fifth rose ceremony took place in London... or did it? Technically it did, but it had to be conducted over Zoom because <a href=#>Zach tested positive for COVID-19</a> following his 1-on-1 date with Gabi. Because of this, the women were robbed of a romantic week in England. However, this tragedy didn't stop the leading man from sending home two more women.</p><p>With that said, the two women eliminated during the fifth rose ceremony were Mercedes Northup and Kylee Russell.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 4 — Feb. 13, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The fourth rose ceremony, which took place in the beautiful Bahamas, saw Zach eliminating <a href=#>Genevie Mayo</a> and Davia Bunch. They both went on the group date, and it seems they just couldn't further their respective connections with the leading man. As for 30-year-old content marketing manager <a href=#>Anastasia Keramidas,</a> she was sent home before the rose ceremony because Zach heard she was there for the wrong reasons.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 3 — Feb. 6, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Just a week after meeting Zach's entire family on her one-on-one date, <a href=#>Christina Mandrell</a> was eliminated during the third rose ceremony. Apparently, her behavior at the cocktail party was unacceptable — she was acting erratic and drank too much. Plus, Christina's drama with <a href=#>Brianna Thorbourne</a> was too much for Zach to handle.</p><p>Speaking of Brianna, she ended up self-eliminating at the pool party because of <a href=#>Christina's bullying</a>. As for <a href=#>Bailey Brown</a>, she was sent packing before the rose ceremony.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 2 — Jan. 30, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The second rose ceremony saw Zach sending home Cat Carter, Kimberly Gutierrez, and Victoria Jameson. Cat went on the first group date, a competition hosted by Latto and judged by <a href=#>Victoria Fuller</a>, Courtney Robertson, and <a href=#>Tahzjuan Hawkins</a>. She didn't have the bad b---h energy Zach was looking for, and as a result, she was sent packing.</p><p>As for Kimberly and Victoria, the two went on the second group date and didn't form genuine connections with Zach.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Week 1 — Jan. 23, 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For the first time in over a decade, 10 people were sent home on night one.</p><p>The most dramatic elimination belongs to Madison Johnson, who was very outspoken about her attraction to Zach. After he gave the first impression to <a href=#>Greer Blitzer</a>, Madison became upset and pulled Zach aside. He said he wasn’t feeling it, and instead of stringing her along, he sent Madison home.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>The rest of the ladies — Cara Ammon, Holland Parsons, Lekha Ravi, Olivia Lewis, Olivia Miller, Becca Serrano, Sonia Sharma, Vanessa Dinh, and Viktoria Eichner — didn't get much screen time and weren't able to speak with Zach. As a result, they didn't make much of an impression on the leading man.</p><p>Tune in every Monday at 8 p.m. EST on ABC to see who goes home on The Bachelor!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwedaepa1lmKS6pnnOp2StoJVir6Kvx56jqKpdqLKiv86nZGtv</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./crawford-collins-19970415-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Crawford Collins (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-char-million-dollar-listing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet the Owner of Arizona's &amp;quot;Bella Paradiso&amp;quot; From 'Million Dollar Listing'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
