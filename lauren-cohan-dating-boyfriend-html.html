She said she got kissed at the bus stop, and nothing topped that romance. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her second-best date was, unfortunately, not as romantic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Lauren Cohan talked about her dating life in an interview with GQ.</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Source: GQ/YouTube) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She explained to GQ that it happened at a cinema and her date kissed her after he had eaten a bunch of sweets and&nbsp;the sugar got all over her face.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The kiss was not as romantic, but she enjoyed the date. Her idea of a perfect date was to keep things traditional.&nbsp;</p><p>She loved it when a guy picked her up and paid for dinner and was&nbsp;open about his&nbsp;attraction toward her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I’m a big believer in if he’s into you he will not keep it a secret and so I chase nothing I just sort of let the universe show itself to me,” said Cohan.</p><p>Another important thing for&nbsp;the actress was fun and laughter.</p><p>She did not want to engage in serious conversations and would rather spend an entire evening laughing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Cohan then exemplified <a href=# rel=follow>Steven Yeun</a>, her co-star on&nbsp;The Walking Dead,&nbsp;who plays her husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She said Yeun's character as Steven Glenn on the hit series&nbsp;was a perfect date.

Oh, it is them!’ There are entire websites dedicated to the proof that Steven and I are in a relationship. Which is always funny because it’s not,” said the actress.</p><p>She explained that dating rumors started as she and most of her co-stars lived within two buildings and five seconds from each other, and they would all go to coffee and drink at the same place. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Besides, Yuen has been married to photographer Joana Pak since 2016.
