Read on to find out where the reports came from, and for a refresher on how long the two have been together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Quavo cheating on Saweetie?</h2><p>The couple had been together for years, but some fans are wondering if there were significant issues going on in their relationship â€” specifically, whether cheating was involved.</p><p>During a livestream for the Verzuz rap battle between Jeezy and Gucci Mane, which took place on Nov. 19, 2020, comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerald Huston</a> posted a comment asking Quavo if he was unfaithful to Saweetie.</p><p>"@Quavohuncho u still f-----g Colormenae?" Gerald wrote in a comment. Colormenae is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reginae Carter's Instagram</a> handle.</p><p>Reginae Carter is an actress and reality star who is also known for being the daughter of rapper Lil Wayne. She was also reportedly in a relationship with YFN Lucci at the time.</p><p>Gerald's comments got fans stirring online, as many wondered if there was any truth to the rumor.&nbsp;</p><p>While Saweetie and Quavo did not directly respond to Gerald's allegation, he has a YouTube channel that is filled with prank videos. Gerald also has a reputation for trolling celebrities in their comment sections and during Instagram lives.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>After posting the comment about Quavo and Reginae, Gerald put up Instagram Stories that showcased screenshots of other troll-like comments he left on the rap livestream. These included irreverent comments to Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union, Offset and Cardi B, and Ja Rule.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it does not appear as if his message toward Quavo was founded in truth.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Following their breakup, Quavo hinted that Saweetie may have cheated on him.</h2><p>Reports that Quavo and Saweetie ended their relationship came in March 2021 and by March 19, the Migos rapper confirmed the split via Twitter.</p><p>"I know you want to make this into a show so I'll play my part just this one time," he tweeted. "I don't normally put my business out there, especially my personal life. I feel the need to address this so there are no false narratives."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>In another tweet, Quavo seemed to insinuate that Saweetie may have cheated on him.</p><p>"I had love for you and disappointed you did all that. You are not the woman I thought you were. I wish you nothing but the best."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Though Saweetie and Quavo only made their relationship Instagram official in March of 2019, the two had been together for much longer.</p><p>In October of 2020, Quavo shared his take on the "How It Started vs. How It's Going" meme by posting a screenshot of the moment when he slid into Saweetie's DMs.&nbsp;</p><p>The DM exchange took place in March of 2018, and Quavo sent Saweetie a snowflake emoji.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>HOW I PULLED UP: HOW WE COMING ðŸ˜‚ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hIYyicrfIj</a></p>â€” QuavoYRN (@QuavoStuntin) <a href=#>October 7, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>She responded with a steaming bowl emoji. Quavo followed it up by writing, "U so icy, I'm a glacier boy."</p><p>"Was hannin then?" Saweetie replied, and the rest was history. &nbsp;</p><p>As for the "How It's Going" part of the meme, Quavo posted a photo of him enjoying a cocktail with Saweetie.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear whether there was cheating involved in Quavo and Saweetie's breakup. But one thing's for sure: The rappers are no longer romantically involved â€” and something serious went down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpsKiws5mmqGdkam2r7OMqKVmq5GssqbAyJ4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./helen-hunt-bikini-malibu-beach-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Helen Hunt Rocks Bikini At The Beach &amp;amp; Looks Incredible Pics Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pierce-brosnan-sons-out-laws-premiere-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Pierce Brosnan Joined By Look-Alike Sons At The Out-Laws Premiere Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
