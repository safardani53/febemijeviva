He got his start in the 1994 classic&nbsp;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.&nbsp;His career took off even further after he starred in&nbsp;The Mask&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dumb & Dumber.&nbsp;He has a number of other comedic credits to his name including The Cable Guy, Liar Liar, The Truman Show and How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Just like his career, he also has an extensive dating history. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>comedian</a> met his first wife <strong>Melissa Womer</strong> in a comedy club as his career was just starting to take off in 1986. The two wed a year later in 1987 but separated in 1995. He got married to&nbsp;<strong>Lauren Holly&nbsp;</strong>shortly after in 1996 but the two ended up splitting a year later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jane-Carrey-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>He has also dated a number of A-listers including <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January Jones</a>,&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Renee Zellweger</a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jenny McCarthy</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The Golden Globe winner’s most recent relationship on record was with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cathriona White</a>&nbsp;</strong>who died from suicide in 2015. While those relationships didn’t last, he did find ever-lasting love from his first marriage when he welcomed his one and only daughter into the world. Here’s everything you need to know about her.</p><h2><span><span><i>Jane Erin Carrey</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jane-Carrey-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jim Carrey and Melissa Womer welcomed their daughter<strong> Jane Erin Carrey&nbsp;</strong>six months into their marriage on September 6, 1987. The 34-year-old also pursued a career in the entertainment industry like her father but didn’t go for comedy. Instead, she aspired to be a musician. In fact, the comedian’s daughter appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Idol</a>&nbsp;in 2012. She passed her first audition in San Diego with her successful rendition of&nbsp;<strong>Bonnie Raitt’s&nbsp;</strong>“Something to Talk About.” However, she said goodbye during Hollywood week after singing “Looking Out My Backdoor” by Creedence Clearwater Revival.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I freaked out when I was there so I was really really shaky,” she said of her performance on the show. “I know I can do way better than that so I’m really disappointed.” She was able to seek comfort from none other than her famous father. “I talked to my dad and he was kind of comforting,” she continued. “He said ‘I’ve been said no to a bunch of times’ and it worked out for him, so hopefully I have a shot.” Aside from her brief stint on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Idol</a>,&nbsp;she has a band called The Jane Carrey band which released a self-titled album in 2009. Their song “Sticky Situation” appeared in her father’s film&nbsp;Dumb & Dumber To’s&nbsp;soundtrack.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jane also made Jim a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grandpa</a> back in 2010. She gave birth on February 26 to <strong>Jackson Riley Santana, </strong>a boy whom she shares with her husband and Blood Money lead singer&nbsp;<strong>Alex Santana.&nbsp;</strong>Ahead of the birth, Jane was relieved to find out she’d be having a boy. &nbsp;“I’m excited about it because I never really got along with girls growing up,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;at the time. “I was a little afraid that if it was a girl that she would not like me, you know? So I’m very happy about the boy.” Jim was proud of his daughter and confidently told the outlet she was going to be a “great mom.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mipGabkae%2FpsWMnZiun5ipsrN5k29pbWpkanw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./irene-major-children-christmas-harrods.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My heart stopped for 7 minutes giving birth to my ninth child - so Im spending 100k spoiling my</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-hough-snaps-get-out-julianne-flirts-paula-abdul.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Derek Hough snaps 'get out!' at sister Julianne as he tries to flirt with 'gorgeous' guest judge on</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./georg-listing.html>Georg Listing Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./selena-gomez-concert-outfits-revival-tour-costumes-photos.html>Her Sexiest Costumes From Revival Tour Hollywood Life</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fined-banned-driving-vaping-behind-wheel.html>Is it illegal to vape while driving?
